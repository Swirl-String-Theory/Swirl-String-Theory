% Minimal local shim for cuted.sty to support sn-jnl.cls
% This is a lightweight compatibility layer that avoids layout tricks.
% It defines a no-op strip environment so that sn-jnl can compile.

% Basic strip environment: simply typesets contents in a single-column box.
% This is much simpler than the real cuted implementation but is adequate
% for manuscripts that do not rely on fancy two-column spanning behavior
% in the title area.
