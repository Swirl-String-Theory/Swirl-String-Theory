  "description": "<div>\n<pre>The Equivalence Principle (EP) has long guided the geometric interpretation of gravitation, yet its foundational status has become increasingly ambiguous. This ambiguity arises from three independent developments: operational derivations of relativistic kinematics from causality alone, relational formulations of quantum dynamics based on clock--system correlations, and the geometric trinity of gravity, in which curvature-, torsion-, and non-metricity-based formulations are dynamically equivalent but conceptually distinct. In this work, we synthesize these lines into a unified framework. Lorentzian causal structure is fixed operationally, while gravitational redshift and effective Newtonian interaction terms emerge from relational time dynamics under mild deformations of the Hamiltonian constraint. Within this setting, the EP is naturally reinterpreted as an emergent low-energy symmetry rather than a fundamental axiom. The main contribution is a structural synthesis that identifies which components of the usual EP narrative are logically primary and which are recovered as low-energy consequences of relational clock dynamics and connection-based encodings. We delineate the domain in which this reinterpretation is valid, clarify the role of the affine connection in mediating inertial and gravitational effects, and identify coherence-dependent corrections to redshift as a well-defined target for quantum-clock experiments.%</pre>\n</div>",
