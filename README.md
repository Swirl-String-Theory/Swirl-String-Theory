# 🌌 Swirl–String Theory (SST)

Welcome to the edge where **fluid dynamics, topology, and field theory** collide.  
This repository is the canonical home for the **Swirl–String Theory (SST)** project — an extension of the earlier **Vortex Æther Model (VAM)**.

Here, spacetime isn’t just a stage: it swirls, knots, and resonates.  
Matter appears as **topological vortex strings**, time ticks via **swirl clocks**, and interaction strengths emerge from geometry rather than arbitrary couplings.

> If spacetime can bend, why shouldn’t it knot?

    - Vorticity-induced gravity
    - Swirl–String Lagrangians mirroring the Standard Model
    - Knot-based mass spectra without Yukawa parameters
    - Warp drive, anti-gravity, and cosmic-scale swirl networks

- **💻 Code (Python)**  
  Scripts for computing:
    - Knot helicity & chirality classification
    - Invariant mass predictions from swirl topology
    - Biot–Savart vortex simulations
    - Equation extraction from `.fseries` source files

- **📊 Data**  
  Raw CSVs and results tables from helicity sweeps, mass benchmarks, and classification tests.  
  All reproducible with the provided scripts.

## 📦 Releases

All finalized papers are also archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) with DOIs for citation stability.  
Each release here matches a Zenodo record.

## ⚙️ Tools & Workflow

- Python scripts for **helcity & mass evaluation** (`HelicityCalculationVAMcore.py`, `SST_INVARIANT_MASS*.py`)
- Equation harvesting from `.fseries` source (thanks to [David Fremlin’s knot library](https://david.fremlin.de/knots/index.htm))
- Planned: visualization notebooks for swirl clocks, vortex lensing, and knotted fields.

## 🧭 Why This Project?

SST aims to replace arbitrary particle physics “free parameters” with **geometric/topological invariants of swirl strings**.  
Highlights:
- No Yukawas: fermion masses emerge from knot energies.
- Gauge couplings as swirl mixing angles.
- Gravity as structured swirl dynamics, not curvature.
- Time as vortex phase, with a shared **ætheric Now**.
