  "description": "In Swirl–String Theory (SST), each elementary particle is represented by a quantized knotted vortex loop in an underlying {ther-like fluid. The knot type and its symmetries encode the particle’s quantum numbers (mass, charge, chirality, ) . The canon adopts the following taxonomy: \\( \\) \\( \\) Below we map the SM content—three generations of quarks and leptons, plus gauge bosons—onto their SST vortex–knot representatives, following the canonical rules and the helicity/mass analyses.",
