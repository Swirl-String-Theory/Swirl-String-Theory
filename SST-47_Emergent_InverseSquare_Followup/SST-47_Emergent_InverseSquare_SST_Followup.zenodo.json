  "description": "A recurrent objection to emergent or flat-background gravity programs is that the inverse-square distance law is often imported rather than derived. In the static, weak-field, spherically symmetric (monopole) sector, we close this gap by exhibiting three independent derivations of the \\(1/r\\) potential and \\(1/r^2\\) flux. (I) A minimal Gauss-law scalar effective field theory (EFT) for the far-field mediator yields the Poisson equation, whose Green's function in \\(^3\\) is \\(1/r\\). (II) We identify the SST far-field carrier as a foliation (``Swirl-Clock'') scalar perturbation, write its quadratic EFT, compute its spatial stress tensor \\(T_{ij}\\), and show that its conserved radial momentum-flux density satisfies \\(_r\\) in a separate step.",
