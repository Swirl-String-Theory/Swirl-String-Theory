  "description": "<p>Abstract</p>\n<p>We present a geometric reformulation of electromagnetism based on the hydrodynamics of a structured, director-bearing, inviscid, and incompressible substrate. Using Cartan&rsquo;s structure equations in a teleparallel (Weitzenb&ouml;ck) geometry, we identify the electromagnetic field strength 2-form as the projection of spacetime torsion along a fixed internal direction, \\( F \\equiv \\kappa u_a T^a \\), which guarantees the Bianchi identity \\( dF=0 \\). In this framework, the photon emerges not as a fundamental point particle, but as a massless transverse shear-like wave of the substrate&rsquo;s director field.</p>\n<p>From an effective hydrodynamic (gauge-fixed) Lagrangian that is equivalent to the Maxwell action, we obtain the linearized vector wave equation and demonstrate that the speed of light \\( c \\)&nbsp;is determined by the ratio of the substrate's effective shear stiffness to its effective mass density. Furthermore, we predict a vacuum magneto-optical response: in the presence of a parity-odd substrate coupling aligned with a background field, a <strong>non-zero vacuum Verdet constant</strong> (linear-in-\\( B \\) Faraday rotation) arises&mdash;distinct from the parity-even, quadratic-in-\\( B \\)&nbsp;birefringence of standard Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). This framework offers falsifiable targets for high-intensity laser experiments and magnetar polarimetry.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Mathematical &amp; Physical Results:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Geometric Unification:</strong> The electromagnetic potential \\( A_\\mu \\) is identified with the coframe displacement of the vacuum substrate, and the field strength &nbsp;\\( F_{\\mu\\nu} \\) is identified with projected Cartan Torsion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Massless Shear Modes:</strong> The \"director-bearing\" (nematic-like) nature of the substrate allows for transverse wave propagation without viscous damping, resolving historical drag paradoxes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Vacuum Faraday Rotation:</strong> A derivation of the Vacuum Verdet constant, \\( \\mathcal{V}_{\\text{vac}} \\approx \\alpha_{\\text{vac}}/2 \\), predicting a linear optical rotation in vacuum distinct from the Euler-Heisenberg QED prediction.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Keywords</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Electromagnetism, Cartan Geometry, Spacetime Torsion, Hydrodynamic Vacuum, Analogue Gravity, Vacuum Birefringence, Verdet Constant, Topological Fluid Dynamics, Teleparallel Gravity, Unified Field Theory</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Notes</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This work bridges the gap between classical fluid mechanics and modern gauge field theories using differential geometry.
