  "description": "<div>\n<pre>Swirl--String Theory (SST) models electrons as topologically stable, knotted vortex filaments in an incompressible, inviscid condensate. Within this framework, atomic orbitals emerge as hydrodynamic equilibrium configurations rather than probabilistic wavefunctions. A central consistency challenge is whether internal Kelvin-wave excitations of the electron filament could introduce thermodynamic corrections large enough to destabilize the hydrogenic energy spectrum. We show that, without additional structure, such corrections would exceed observational limits by many orders of magnitude. However, a topologically induced excitation gap in the Kelvin spectrum&mdash;of order \\(\\mathcal{O}(10^2\\text{--}10^3\\,\\mathrm{eV})\\)&mdash;naturally suppresses these effects. As a result, the Schr&ouml;dinger equation arises as a low-energy equation of state, while Kelvin dynamics are inert except under extreme acceleration or high-energy conditions. This establishes a robust separation of scales in SST and resolves a key constraint for its viability as a physical model.</pre>\n</div>",
