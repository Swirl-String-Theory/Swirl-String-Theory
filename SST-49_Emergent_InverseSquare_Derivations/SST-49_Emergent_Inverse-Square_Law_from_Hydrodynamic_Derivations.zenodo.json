  "description": "A recurrent objection to flat-background, emergent-gravity programs is that the inverse-square distance law is often imported rather than derived. We close this gap in the weak-field, static monopole sector by exhibiting three independent derivations of the \\(1/r\\) potential and \\(1/r^2\\) flux. (I) A Gauss-law scalar effective field theory (EFT) for the far-field mediator yields the Poisson equation whose Green's function in \\(^3\\) is \\(1/r\\). (II) Identifying the specific SST far-field degree of freedom as a foliation/clock scalar, we compute its quadratic EFT stress tensor \\(T_{ij}\\) and show the associated conserved radial flux density scales as \\(1/r^2\\), with charge \\(Q^3\\) Green's function.",
