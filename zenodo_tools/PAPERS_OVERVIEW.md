### SST-00_Lagrangian

**Title:** A Hydrodynamic Lagrangian Framework for Swirl--String Theory

**Abstract:**

We present the Lagrangian formulation of Swirl–String Theory (SST), a fluid–topological effective field theory in which quantized circulation of an incompressible background generates matter and radiation. Closed knotted string excitations serve as particle states, and transverse swirl modes recover the Lorentz-invariant photon wave equation while dynamics unfold relative to an underlying foliation time. Mass follows from topological invariants via a canonical scaling law set by a single dimensionful constant, yielding parameter values that benchmark against observed lepton and baryon masses. The Lagrangian also accommodates parity-violating and contact terms, enabling interaction vertices analogous to Yukawa and weak couplings. The framework makes concrete predictions: I: quantized flux impulses from reconnection events, II: interference-visibility decay driven by finite-amplitude swirl, and III: skyrmionic photon textures indexed by knot chirality. SST thereby extends the tradition of hydrodynamic and analogue-gravity models while providing a testable, realist alternative to conventional quantum postulates.

### SST-01_Rosetta

**Title:** Field-Level Lagrangian Correspondences

**Abstract:**

We present (SST), a novel hydrodynamic effective field theory providing a unified framework for modeling quantum particles and gauge interactions as knotted vortex filaments within a universal incompressible swirl condensate. SST establishes field-level correspondences with both string theory and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by identifying a set of precise structural analogies: the fundamental string action and non-Abelian gauge fields are mirrored by a 2-form vorticity flux field $B_{$ and a swirl connection $W_

### SST-02_Knot_Classified

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

In Swirl–String Theory (SST), each elementary particle is represented by a quantized knotted vortex loop in an underlying {ther-like fluid. The knot type and its symmetries encode the particle’s quantum numbers (mass, charge, chirality, ) . The canon adopts the following taxonomy: {Unknotted loops} ${Torus knots} ${Chiral hyperbolic knots} ${Amphichiral (mirror-symmetric) knots} $.

### SST-05_Einstein_to_SST

**Title:** Conclusion and Forward Outlook: Structured Space Revisited

**Abstract:**

This paper revisits Einstein’s later remarks on a structured space and proposes a modern realization in a swirl–string framework with preferred foliation. The medium is modeled as an incompressible, inviscid condensate supporting quantized circulation along closed filaments (swirl strings). Gravitational and inertial phenomena arise from swirl-induced pressure gradients and coherent circulation, with local time scaling governed by the tangential swirl speed. Mass corresponds to localized topological tension, and attraction emerges from Bernoulli-like pressure deficits sustained by circulation invariants. The framework yields testable predictions for clock behavior, frame-dragging analogues, and vorticity-coupled fields, with analog implementations in superfluids and optical platforms. We argue that “structured space” is neither obsolete nor purely geometric: it is a dynamic, quantized substrate amenable to precise modeling and experiment.

### SST-06_Classical_Electron_Radius

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

We show that three standard, independently defined electron scales---the classical electron radius $r_e$, the Compton angular frequency $ = m_e { \, r_c = {2} m_e c^2 = {. \] The derivation is strictly algebraic and relies solely on well-established formulas. We discuss the historical origin of the underlying scales (classical electron models, Compton scattering, Bohr's hydrogen theory) and comment on the structural interdependence of atomic, relativistic, and classical electromagnetic quantities revealed by this identity.

### SST-07_Rotational_Kinetic_Energy

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

Kinetic energy contributes to inertia and gravitational mass through the relativistic relation $E = mc^2$. In extended media such as fluids, this contribution can be expressed as an effective mass density associated with internal motion. I compute the volume-averaged rotational kinetic energy density for an incompressible, inviscid Newtonian fluid in rigid-body rotation inside a finite cylinder. Associating this energy density with an effective mass density via $E = mc^2$ (nonrelativistic limit) yields the closed-form relation \[ }}{ = {4}}}{c}}$ is the tangential speed at the cylinder boundary and $

### SST-08_Circulation_Rigid_Rotation

**Title:** Acknowledgments

**Abstract:**

Proper time dilation for moving clocks is a central prediction of special relativity and underlies precision technologies such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). In this paper we express kinematic time dilation in a rigidly rotating frame in terms of fluid-mechanical quantities: tangential ``swirl'' speed, vorticity, and circulation. For a clock co-moving with an incompressible, inviscid fluid undergoing rigid-body rotation, we derive the standard special-relativistic result \[ {t} = {c^2}}, $ as \[ {t} = {4}. \] Because circulation is a conserved quantity in inviscid, barotropic flows (Kelvin's theorem), this provides a topological representation of time dilation in terms of a fluid invariant. We compare the resulting scaling with the weak-field Schwarzschild time-dilation factor and illustrate the magnitudes involved for terrestrial rotation and GPS-like orbits. The analysis uses only standard special relativity, elementary general relativity, and classical fluid mechanics.

### SST-09_Energy_Impulse_Stability

**Title:** Acknowledgments

**Abstract:**

Vortex rings and vortex loops in incompressible, inviscid fluids are localized structures that carry finite energy, impulse, and helicity and can propagate over long distances with weak distortion. In this paper we review and organize classical results for thin-core circular vortex rings and extend the discussion to general closed vortex loops, including knotted filaments. For a circular ring of radius $R$, core radius $a {2}{a} - = },{4{a} - } = \|\|/U$ and show how curvature and pressure gradients yield a consistent force balance in the inviscid Euler equations. Finally, we outline the extension to general closed filaments, highlighting how the Biot--Savart representation and the helicity invariant underlie the robustness of knotted vortex loops as finite-energy, bound configurations in classical fluid mechanics. The analysis uses only incompressible Euler flow and established results from vortex dynamics.

### SST-10_Impulsive_Axisymmetric_Forcing

**Title:** Clarifying Notes and Visual Suggestions

**Abstract:**

We analyze impulsive, axisymmetric forcing in a rotating cylinder and its delayed surface ``push--pull'' response using classical inertial-wave theory. Linear rotating Euler equations with standard boundary conditions yield an axisymmetric inertial-wave packet whose vertical group velocity $c_{g,z}$ quantitatively explains the observed arrival time and bipolar surface signature. We compute the reversible swirl (azimuthal velocity $u_

### SST-11_Water_and_Time

**Title:** Rosetta card (SST $

**Abstract:**

We present a one-to-one Swirl--String Theory (SST) translation of a rotating-tank impulse experiment and skyrmionic-photon framework. All sections/equations from the original are preserved, with SST terms added via Rosetta mapping and mainstream physics glosses inline. Macrodynamics remain standard rotating Euler; SST introduces (i) bookkeeping of swirl energy/mass densities and (ii) the canonical \( \) alongside the legacy \( \) hypothesis (kept as an explicit, testable variant). Dimensional checks and numerics use \( \|} \), \( \, \), \( \,} \).

### SST-12_Swirl_Pressure_Gravitational_Acceleration

**Title:** Acknowledgments

**Abstract:**

In incompressible, inviscid fluids, steady rotational motion generates radial pressure gradients that balance centripetal acceleration in the absence of external forces. In this paper we show that, for suitably chosen azimuthal velocity profiles, the associated pressure field can be written in the form of an effective gravitational potential whose radial derivative reproduces familiar Newtonian accelerations. Starting from the steady Euler equations for an axisymmetric swirling flow, we derive the radial balance \[ {p}{r} = {r} - g_r(r), \] and, in the absence of external gravity $g_r = 0$, identify an effective acceleration \( g_{}(r) = v_ \), we obtain \( g_{}(r) = GM/r^2 \) and a pressure field $p(r)$ whose contribution per unit mass, $p/

### SST-13_Gravitational_Modulation

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

: adjusting perceived gravity by altering circulation, alignment, or topology of swirl structures. We (i) summarize the SST constants and the softened ``swirl Coulomb'' potential, (ii) show how additive or opposing circulation strengthens or weakens attraction, (iii) describe anisotropy via alignment, phasing, and bulk rotation, and (iv) outline predicted electromagnetic co-signatures of topological changes. We close with feasibility bounds and near-term analog experiments.

### SST-14_Gravitational_Behavior

**Title:** 1.

**Abstract:**

I summarize the SST constants and bounds that fix the scale of any effect and then outline three classes of control: (i) modulating strength by adding or countering circulation; (ii) imposing directionality by aligning structures, phasing oscillations, or using bulk rotation; and (iii) attempting shielding, reflection or redirection by topological and dynamical means. For each, I discuss feasibility, energetic thresholds, and SST's built-in maximum-force limit. A key falsifiable prediction highlighted here is that any topological change to the swirl network that modifies gravitational coupling must co-emit a discrete electromagnetic impulse of fixed magnitude. The overall conclusion is conservative: macroscopic ``gravity control'' demands energy densities that push against SST's own limits, yet small, testable effects may be accessible in superfluid or Bose--Einstein--condensate analogs.

### SST-15_Circulation_Loop_Thermodynamics

**Title:** Acknowledgments

**Abstract:**

We investigate a classical analogue model for thermal radiation based on an incompressible, inviscid fluid populated by thin circulation loops (vortex rings) of finite core radius. Treating closed circulation loops as localized, finite-energy structures with effective mass $M_{}$, we construct a kinetic theory of a dilute loop gas in the canonical ensemble. The resulting partition function coincides with that of a classical ideal gas, and the equation of state $P V = N k_{ T$ follows in the standard way from the Helmholtz free energy. For an isotropic ensemble of ultra-relativistic or effectively massless excitations built from these loops, the relation $P = {3}u$ between pressure and energy density is recovered from the momentum flux tensor, relying only on three-dimensional isotropy and the relativistic relation $E = pc$. A finite core radius $a$ and an upper bound $v_{$ on the tangential speed inside the cores imply a kinematic maximum internal frequency $ = v_{/a$. If electromagnetic normal modes are identified with mechanically realizable excitations of this medium, only modes with $$ are thermally accessible. The classical Rayleigh--Jeans integral is then automatically regulated, yielding a finite energy density $u T\,^3$ without any modification of Maxwell's equations. The resulting cutoff Rayleigh--Jeans spectrum does not reproduce the $T^4$ scaling of the Planck law and therefore does not replace quantum statistics. Instead, it provides an explicit mechanical example in which microstructure and finite rotational frequencies eliminate the classical ultraviolet catastrophe at the level of microstate counting, while leaving intact the standard macroscopic equations of motion and equations of state.

### SST-17_Photon_Torsion_Wave

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

We present a geometric reformulation of electromagnetism based on the hydrodynamics of a structured, director-bearing, inviscid and incompressible substrate. Using Cartan’s structure equations in a teleparallel (Weitzenböck) geometry, we identify the electromagnetic field strength 2-form as the of spacetime torsion along a fixed internal direction, $F wave of the substrate’s director field. From an effective hydrodynamic (gauge-fixed) Lagrangian that is equivalent to the Maxwell action, we obtain the vector wave equation and show that the wave speed is $c=$, i.e., the ratio of effective shear stiffness to effective mass density. Furthermore, we predict a vacuum magneto-optical response: in the presence of a parity-odd substrate coupling aligned with a background field, a (linear-in-$B$ Faraday rotation) arises—distinct from the parity-even, quadratic-in-$B$ birefringence of standard QED. This provides clean, falsifiable targets for high-intensity laser experiments and magnetar polarimetry.

### SST-18_Unifying_EM_Gravity

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

We present a unified field theory based on the hydrodynamics of an inviscid, incompressible, director-bearing fluid substrate. We demonstrate that Relativistic kinematic effects emerge naturally from circulation conservation: proper time dilation is derived as a function of fluid circulation $, while effective mass arises from rotational kinetic energy density $$. We identify the photon not as a point particle, but as a propagating torsion wave (shear wave) within this substrate, predicting a vacuum Faraday effect recently supported by experimental data on optical magnetic torques (Assouline & Capua, 2025). Furthermore, we show that steady-swirl Euler pressure gradients yield a short-range $1/r^3$ force for filamentary $v_^3$, , and that the fundamental electron scales ($r_e, .

### SST-19_Hydrodynamic_Origin_Hydrogen

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

This research report presents a comprehensive derivation of the hydrogen ground state within the framework of Swirl-String Theory (SST), a hydrodynamic effective field theory that models the vacuum not as an abstract geometric manifold or a probabilistic quantum field, but as a frictionless, incompressible, superfluid-like condensate. By identifying the electron and proton as topologically stable knotted vortex filaments (``swirl strings'') characterized by quantized circulation, the theory recovers the phenomenological predictions of quantum mechanics and general relativity from purely classical fluid-mechanical and topological constraints. The report motivates a regularized ``Swirl--Coulomb'' effective potential using near-field Euler pressure balance (which yields a pressure deficit $^3$. Furthermore, the analysis unifies the classical electron radius, the Compton wavelength, and the Bohr radius through a single harmonic oscillator construction rooted in the medium's parameters..} The derivation yields the hydrogen ground state energy $E_B$ and the fine-structure constant $

### SST-21_Knot_Taxonomy

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

This note develops a definitive symmetry and topological taxonomy of knots as candidate swirl--string configurations in Swirl--String Theory (SST). Building on standard knot tables, we organise prime knots (with emphasis on torus and hyperbolic knots up to eight crossings, plus selected higher-crossing exceptions) by their discrete symmetry groups, including $D_2(r)$, higher dihedral $D_{2k}$, cyclic $Z_{2k}$, and inversion symmetries $I_m$. For each knot type $K$ we record reversibility, (positive/negative) amphichirality, allowed rotational periods, and the full symmetry group, and we supplement these with SST-relevant topological invariants: crossing number, braid index, Seifert genus, number of components, and (where applicable) hyperbolic volume $$. Amphichiral knots are identified as the natural candidates for the SST dark sector, with positive amphichirality associated to cyclic ($Z_{2k}$--type) symmetry and negative amphichirality to inversion ($I_2$--type) symmetry. Within this taxonomy we single out a minimal set of torus knots to represent the charged lepton ladder and a family of chiral hyperbolic knots to represent quark states, while the unknot and links (e.g.\ Hopf-type) provide bosonic and neutrino templates. A central outcome is the introduction of a dimensionless $_{M}(K)$ that depends only on braid index, genus, and component count, and which enters the SST invariant mass kernel $M(T)=\,_{M}(K(T))\,L_{}(T)$ for a given geometric realisation $T$ of type $K(T)$. In this way the tables presented here serve simultaneously as a symmetry catalogue and as a practical lookup layer between the combinatorial data of knot theory and the quantitative mass predictions of SST for leptons, baryons, nuclei, molecules, and potential dark-sector excitations. The taxonomy is designed to be extensible: additional prime knots, links, and composite knot graphs can be incorporated without altering the underlying classification scheme.

### SST-22_Hydrodynamic_Origin_Hydrogen_Old

**Title:** I. Introduction

**Abstract:**

This research report presents a comprehensive derivation of the hydrogen ground state within the framework of Swirl-String Theory (SST), a hydrodynamic effective field theory that models the vacuum not as an abstract geometric manifold or a probabilistic quantum field, but as a frictionless, incompressible, superfluid-like condensate. By identifying the electron and proton as topologically stable knotted vortex filaments ("swirl strings") characterized by quantized circulation, the theory recovers the phenomenological predictions of quantum mechanics and general relativity from purely classical fluid-mechanical and topological constraints. The report rigorously establishes the "Swirl-Coulomb" potential from the Euler equations of the medium, demonstrating that the $1/r$ electrostatic interaction emerges inevitably from the pressure gradients induced by conserved circulation. Furthermore, the analysis unifies the classical electron radius, the Compton wavelength, and the Bohr radius through a single harmonic oscillator construction rooted in the medium's parameters. The derivation yields the hydrogen ground state energy $E_B$ and the fine-structure constant $

### SST-23_Dual_Vacuum_Unification

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

We develop a falsifiable hydrodynamic extension of field theory in which the vacuum consists of two interacting, incompressible continua: a fast electromagnetic sector with characteristic propagation speed $c$, and a slower rotational Swirl sector with speed $|\,$m/s. Using Helmholtz--Kelvin vortex dynamics, we show that acceleration excites vorticity stretching rather than compression, producing a primary Swirl burst with characteristic delay $ $, this burst dissipates non-radiatively, leaving a secondary photon ``Unruh Echo'' at $

### SST-24_Thermodynamics

**Title:** Appendix A: Hydrodynamic Energy, Adiabatic Work, and Core Scaling

**Abstract:**

We develop a comprehensive thermodynamic formulation of Swirl--String Theory (SST), in which the physical vacuum is modeled as a frictionless, incompressible swirl condensate, and all matter arises as topologically stabilized vortex filaments (``swirl strings''). Building on the quantum--thermodynamic isomorphism of Abe \& Okuyama, we demonstrate that hydrogenic structure, particle masses, vacuum fluctuations, and interaction lifetimes can be reinterpreted as thermodynamic processes involving the swelling, compression, and mode--excitation of vortex cores. We define SST Work as the mechanical energy required to deform the vortex core radius against the surrounding swirl pressure, and SST Heat as the energy redistributed among Kelvin modes and topological phase channels. Applying this framework to hydrogen, we show that the Bohr radius is not a probabilistic orbital shell but a thermodynamic equilibrium surface where centrifugal swirl pressure balances vacuum tension. We reinterpret the Golden Layer mass hierarchy as a discrete thermodynamic scaling law governed by the golden ratio, emerging from log--periodic structure in the swirl energy density. The Unruh Echo is shown to arise from a two--stage thermodynamic response: a 0.1 ns vorticity burst followed by a delayed electromagnetic transduction pulse around 30 ns. Finally, we derive partition functions, heat capacities, and provide numerical evaluation for a simplified Golden ladder.

### SST-25_Hydrogenic_Orbitals

**Title:** 1. Introduction: The Ontological Shift from Probability to Hydrodynamics

**Abstract:**

This research report presents an exhaustive derivation of the thermodynamic structure underlying Swirl-String Theory (SST), positing that the quantum mechanical behavior of electron orbitals arises not from probabilistic wavefunctions, but from the deterministic thermodynamics of a frictionless, incompressible "swirl condensate." By integrating the Abe-Okuyama quantum-thermodynamic isomorphism with the hydrodynamic axioms of SST, we derive a "Master Formula" for the thermodynamic equilibrium of hydrogenic orbitals. We demonstrate that the Bohr radius represents a surface of vanishing "swirl temperature" (geometric strain), and that excited states correspond to discrete adiabatic acoustic resonances of the vortex filament. The report further details the partition functions, entropy contributions (Kelvin-mode vs. Topological), and the Golden-ratio-governed mass hierarchies that emerge from this framework. We conclude that the Schrödinger equation is fundamentally an equation of state for a superfluid vacuum, where energy quantization results from the topological conservation of circulation and the mechanical stability of vortex cores. This document serves as a comprehensive foundational text, synthesizing the hydrodynamic ontology with thermodynamic principles to offer a parameter-free derivation of atomic structure.

### SST-26_Neutrinos

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

Neutrinos appear exclusively left-handed in low-energy interactions. In the Standard Model this is imposed by construction through the $SU(2)_L$ chiral gauge structure. In this paper we derive an alternative, purely geometric origin for neutrino chirality based on the swirl–clock structure of Swirl–String Theory (SST). A universal timelike field $u^}^{$, which itself arises from harmonic motion at the Compton frequency over the classical radius. Integrating out the right-chiral neutrino generates a low-energy effective theory with a single propagating chiral state—recovering the observed left-handed neutrino sector. Hydrogen's $3

### SST-29_Kelvin_Mode_Suppression

**Title:** Introduction

**Abstract:**

Swirl--String Theory (SST) models electrons as topologically stable, knotted vortex filaments in an incompressible, inviscid condensate. Within this framework, atomic orbitals emerge as hydrodynamic equilibrium configurations rather than probabilistic wavefunctions. A central consistency challenge is whether internal Kelvin-wave excitations of the electron filament could introduce thermodynamic corrections large enough to destabilize the hydrogenic energy spectrum. We show that, without additional structure, such corrections would exceed observational limits by many orders of magnitude. However, a topologically induced excitation gap in the Kelvin spectrum—of order $(10^210^3\,)$—naturally suppresses these effects. As a result, the Schrödinger equation arises as a low-energy equation of state, while Kelvin dynamics are inert except under extreme acceleration or high-energy conditions. This establishes a robust separation of scales in SST and resolves a key constraint for its viability as a physical model.

### SST-30_Invariant_Atom_Masses

**Title:** Acknowledgments

**Abstract:**

This manuscript documents a canonical reference implementation of the Swirl--String Theory (SST) invariant mass kernel, as encoded in . The kernel maps a topological object $T$ (specified by braid index $b_T$, Seifert genus $g_T$, component count $n_T$, and a dimensionless total ropelength $L_{}(T)$) into an inertial mass $M(T)$ via a fixed, mode-independent functional. Three computation paths are supported: (strict evaluation with fixed quark-geometry factors), (single baryon-sector normalization fixed by the proton), and (analytic closure in which the proton and neutron are matched exactly without modifying the kernel). A semi-empirical nuclear binding correction is used to map nucleon-level predictions to atomic masses. In the mode (electron, proton, neutron exact by construction), the benchmark over elements H--U yields mean absolute percentage error ${$ with maximum absolute error ${$ for the fixed $(Z,N)$ table used. A small molecule set (19 formulas) yields mean absolute percentage error ${$.

### SST-32_Canonical_Fluid_Reformulation_of_Relativity_and_Quantum_Structure

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

We present (SST), a fluid-topological framework that reinterprets relativity and quantum phenomena via a single incompressible medium. In SST, matter and radiation are modeled as quantized vortex loops () in a universal, non-dissipative condensate. The theory posits that classical gravity emerges as a collective pressure effect of these vortices rather than fundamental spacetime curvature, and that local induce time dilation analogous to relativistic kinematics. We develop the formal field-theoretic Lagrangian for this medium, showing how a preferred foliation and topological quantization yield a discrete particle spectrum: quantum numbers (mass, charge, spin) correspond to topological invariants of knot-like vortex excitations. A modified Faraday's law is derived, unifying electromagnetic induction with rotating-frame effects by predicting that time-varying swirl string density generates an electromotive force. We also describe how SST accounts for wave--particle duality through dual phase (un-knotted vs. knotted) states of vortex loops, with quantum measurement corresponding to topological transitions. Several experimental tests are proposed to falsify or support SST, including quantized electromagnetic impulses from vortex reconnection events, attosecond-scale chirality-dependent time delays in photoemission, and interference degradation due to finite vacuum vorticity. We compare SST with established frameworks---from Kelvin's vortex atom hypothesis to emergent gravity and analogue fluid models---highlighting how SST recovers known limits (Newtonian gravity, Maxwell electrodynamics, quantum wave behavior) while providing novel, quantifiable predictions. All equations are given in SI units with attention to dimensional consistency. The result is a self-contained canonical reformulation that bridges classical and quantum physics through fluid-like continuum mechanics. vortex dynamics; topological fluid; quantum topology; emergent gauge theory; time dilation; wavefu

### SST-35_Resonance-matched-excitation

**Title:** Resonance-Matched Excitation: A General Overlap Model for Beam–Target Spectroscopy, Identifiability, and Optimal Design

**Abstract:**

We formulate a general spectral-overlap functional for beam–target excitation and show how it yields closed-form measurement models, parameter identifiability, and experiment design strategies. A Gaussian source spectrum overlapped with Lorentzian target resonances produces Voigt-type responses with analytic derivatives. We derive Fisher information matrices and Cramér–Rao bounds for spectral parameters and demonstrate parameter recovery on synthetic and benchmark datasets. The framework applies to microwave cavities, mechanical resonators, optical transitions, and other linear spectroscopy systems.

The electron is modeled as a swirl-string admitting two phases: an unknotted, delocalized toroidal circulation $$ (wave-like) and a localized, knotted soliton (trefoil) $$ (particle-like). We define an effective energy functional including bulk swirl density, line tension, near-contact interactions, and helicity terms. Photon-induced transitions $ $ occur at resonant frequencies determined by impedance matching between electromagnetic modes and topological excitations. We show how circulation quantization on $$ recovers de Broglie wave relations, while $$ provides a stable, localized excitation. This framework yields falsifiable predictions in atomic absorption spectra, Rydberg scaling, and polarization-dependent selection rules.

### SST-37_Attosecond-TimeDilation

**Title:** Chirality as Time Asymmetry: A Swirl--String Theory Interpretation of Attosecond Photoionization Delays

**Abstract:**

Han (Nature, 2025) report enantiomer-dependent photoemission delays in gas-phase methyloxirane, with angle-resolved values reaching {. Here we sketch an interpretation in the Swirl--String Theory (SST) picture, where chirality carries a local, direction-sensitive time rate (“Swirl Clock”). Simple estimates map the reported delays to Å-scale effective path differences for the outgoing electron. While this is not a unique explanation—Coulomb–laser coupling and continuum–continuum phases remain plausible contributors—the SST view organizes the observations into a single, testable statement: reversing the Swirl Clock orientation should flip the forward/backward delay. We outline measurements that could falsify the proposal and note where present assumptions are likely to break.

**Title:** Impulsive Axisymmetric Forcing in a Rotating Cylinder:\\ Delayed Surface Response via Inertial Waves and a Fluid-Inspired Kinematic Time Hypothesis

**Abstract:**

We study the free-surface signature produced when a bottom-mounted, axisymmetric, three-fin rotor in a uniformly rotating water column is impulsively accelerated and stopped. The rotor produces a short-lived hollow-core vortex and axial pumping that launch an axisymmetric inertial-wave packet. A delayed ``push--pull'' response is observed at the free surface $$ later, where $H$ is depth and $c_{g,z}$ is the vertical component of inertial-wave group velocity. Linear theory in a cylinder yields the dispersion $=2}$ consistent with centimeter--second scales for typical bench-top parameters. We quantify the sign structure of the two pulses (start/stop) and the coupling to the free surface via hydrostatic balance. Finally, we introduce------a kinematic time-rate rule depending on the local swirl speed. This interpretation predicts parity: surface angle/displacement reverses with the second pulse, while any kinematic time-rate shift is even in the swirl speed and does not. The macrodynamics remain standard rotating Euler; the time-rate hypothesis is presented as testable and independent.

In standard electromagnetism, a tightly focused, linearly polarized beam excites a circular dipole whose radiation carries transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM), behaves as if emitted from a source displaced by $k^{-1}=(10^{-16})$ for optical wavelengths, so that current experiments probe the pure Maxwell limit of SST while still providing a precise Rosetta case for photon topology and spin--orbit coupling.

We formulate a covariant effective field theory on a preferred foliation, show how topological quantization organizes a discrete particle spectrum, and outline a route by which gauge structures may be from orientational textures of the medium. A modified Faraday law is proposed in which time-varying swirl areal density sources an electromotive impulse; this yields geometry-independent, quantized flux signatures that serve as explicit falsification targets. Wave–particle duality is described via R/T phase dynamics (unknotted vs.\ knotted states), with measurement modeled as an R$ established limits (Newtonian gravity, Maxwell electrodynamics, quantum interference) and where it deviations that are testable in BECs, superconducting films, and attosecond spectroscopy.

**Title:** A First-Principles Origin of the Inverse-Square Law in Swirl--String Theory:\\ Three Derivations from Local Field Mediation and Momentum-Flux Conservation

**Abstract:**

A recurrent objection to emergent or flat-background gravity programs is that the inverse-square distance law is often imported rather than derived. In the static, weak-field, spherically symmetric (monopole) sector, we close this gap by exhibiting three independent derivations of the $1/r$ potential and $1/r^2$ flux. (I) A minimal Gauss-law scalar effective field theory (EFT) for the far-field mediator yields the Poisson equation, whose Green's function in $^3$ is $1/r$. (II) We identify the SST far-field carrier as a foliation (``Swirl-Clock'') scalar perturbation, write its quadratic EFT, compute its spatial stress tensor $T_{ij}$, and show that its conserved radial momentum-flux density satisfies $_r$ in a separate step.

**Abstract:**

We present a first-principles derivation of the inverse-square law for static, weak gravitational forces as an emergent phenomenon in a flat, Lorentzian operational background. Building on a recent relational-clock formulation of the Equivalence Principle~, we demonstrate explicitly how a $1/r^2$ dependence arises in a hydrodynamic vortex model of matter consistent with Swirl-String Theory (SST). Three independent approaches are developed: (i) a argument showing that a universal energy–energy interaction leads to a $1/r$ potential when locality is imposed; (ii) a for a foliation field sourced by mass, whose static solution yields the $1/r^2$ field flux of a monopole; and (iii) a derivation based on the stress-energy tensor of the SST scalar field, which reveals an area-weighted momentum flow that falls off as $1/r^2$. We identify the SST field (the ``swirl-clock'' or foliation scalar) that carries the far-field momentum flux and derive its quadratic action and stress-energy tensor. The monopole solution is shown to produce a radial momentum flux density $

### SST-54_Delay-induced_mode_discreteness_in_nonlinear_ring_systems

**Title:** Delay-induced pattern formation as a route to mode discreteness in nonlinear ring systems

**Abstract:**

Nonlinear delayed-feedback systems can display spatio--temporal organization even when governed by a single scalar delay differential equation. Building on the long-delay spatio--temporal analogy , we argue that delay-induced pattern formation can act as a generic classical mechanism for in circulating nonlinear loops. In this perspective, the finite loop transit time defines an effective pseudo-spatial coordinate on which modulational instabilities and front dynamics can select robust plateau-like states. Using a minimal cubic delayed-feedback model as a representative system, we outline how multistability of plateau configurations can be interpreted as discrete circulation patterns in the long-delay regime. We emphasize the scope and limitations of this interpretation, and we distinguish schematic illustration from reproducible numerical evidence.

**Abstract:**

Closed circulation loops with finite propagation speeds constitute a generic class of delayed feedback systems. While spatial boundary conditions are traditionally responsible for mode discretization, we argue that temporal circulation delays alone are sufficient to enforce spectral discreteness through dynamical stability. Drawing on analogies with recent advances in bianisotropic homogenization, we derive a minimal phase-oscillator model for a circulating field. We demonstrate that the finite transit time acts as a selection filter, stabilizing a discrete ladder of stability-selected modes without invoking microscopic quantization. These results suggest that delay-induced discreteness is a universal feature of effective field theories in loops, paralleling the emergence of cross-couplings in spatially asymmetric media.

### SST-56_superfluid

**Title:** Topological Hall Angles and Lifetime Hierarchies of Knotted Vortex Filaments

**Abstract:**

Recent measurements of mutual friction in strongly interacting Fermi superfluids establish a direct link between the transverse dynamics of quantized vortices and the relaxation of localized core states. Motivated by these results, we investigate the dynamics of knotted vortex filaments within an effective hydrodynamic framework. By extending the vortex Hall angle formalism to non-planar filament geometries, we derive a phenomenologically motivated scaling relation between filament topology and internal relaxation times. We show that a hierarchy of decay times emerges naturally from a topology-dependent Reynolds-like barrier, with lifetimes controlled by writhe-dependent geometric phase lags. While no claim is made of microscopic particle identity, the resulting hierarchy closely parallels the ordering observed in several physical systems exhibiting metastable topological excitations.

### SST-57_FermionMasses

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

Recent evidence for the Higgs boson decay into a muon pair provides a direct probe of the Higgs coupling to second--generation charged leptons. In the Standard Model, such couplings are parametrized by Yukawa constants whose origin and hierarchical structure remain unexplained. In this work, we propose an alternative but fully compatible interpretation in which fermion masses arise from localized energy functionals associated with stable fermionic configurations, and Higgs couplings are identified with scalar susceptibilities of these configurations. Within this framework, Yukawa couplings scale automatically with fermion mass, independently of microscopic details. We show that this interpretation naturally accommodates the observed Higgs--muon coupling strength, reproduces charged--lepton mass hierarchies, and yields testable constraints for future precision Higgs measurements. The construction is purely effective, introduces no new particles or interactions, and remains fully consistent with the Standard Model at presently accessible energies.

### SST-58_vacuum_stress_energy_engineering

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

We investigate whether structured electromagnetic near fields with dominant toroidal multipole moments can induce measurable modifications of the quantum vacuum stress--energy tensor. In quantum electrodynamics (QED), vacuum polarization introduces nonlinear corrections to Maxwell electrodynamics described by the Euler--Heisenberg effective Lagrangian. We show that counter-rotating, phase-locked toroidal current configurations (anapole states) maximize these nonlinear field invariants while suppressing radiative losses, thereby concentrating stress in the electromagnetic near field. Interpreted within the polarizable-vacuum representation of gravity, such localized vacuum polarization corresponds to an effective refractive-index gradient and hence to a weak emergent metric perturbation. The predicted effects are extremely small and do not constitute macroscopic gravity control. Instead, the proposal defines a falsifiable laboratory framework for probing the coupling between topological electrodynamics, vacuum stress--energy, and analog gravitational metrics.

### SST-60_Swirl-Clock_Phase_Locking_in_Closed_Circulation_Loops

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

Closed circulation loops with finite propagation time constitute a broad and generic class of delayed feedback systems encountered across fluid dynamics, optics, electronics, and wave physics. In this work we show that such loops admit discrete, dynamically selected phase--locked states even when governed by fully continuous classical dynamics. Using a minimal delayed phase oscillator as a canonical model, we demonstrate that finite circulation time enforces multistable phase--locking conditions indexed by an integer winding number. These phase--locked solutions form a discrete family of circulation modes and provide a purely classical route to mode discreteness in circulating systems, independent of topology, microscopic quantization rules, or particle-based assumptions. The analysis establishes phase locking in long--delay loops as a universal and robust mechanism for the emergence of discrete circulation modes.

### SST-61_Topological_Stabilization_Ideal_Flows

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

Stability in classical continuum systems is commonly associated with energetic optimality, whereby persistent configurations correspond to minima of an appropriate energy functional. However, ideal incompressible flows admit long-lived localized structures that do not satisfy this criterion. In particular, knotted vortex filaments have been observed to persist for many characteristic times despite not corresponding to energy-minimizing states. In this work, we show that the longevity of knotted vortex filaments in ideal incompressible flows arises from topological constraints imposed by helicity conservation, rather than energetic optimality. By analyzing helicity as an active dynamical constraint, we demonstrate that conserved topological invariants restrict admissible decay pathways and obstruct continuous transitions between distinct topological classes. As a result, knotted configurations remain stable in the sense of long-term persistence, even while undergoing continuous dynamical evolution. We distinguish energetic stability from topological stability and show that the latter provides an independent mechanism for robustness in classical continuum systems. Knotted vortex filaments exemplify this mechanism, persisting far from energetic equilibrium due to the structure of the admissible configuration space defined by the Euler equations. These results clarify the role of topology in classical fluid dynamics and suggest that conserved topological quantities should be regarded as fundamental contributors to stability, robustness, and structure formation in ideal and near-ideal flows.

### SST-62_SR_GR_ARE_ONE

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

Special relativity, general relativity, and the universality of free fall are usually introduced as conceptually distinct principles: Lorentz invariance as a kinematical symmetry, Einstein gravity as a dynamical theory of spacetime, and the equivalence principle as an independent postulate. In this work we show that these elements are not logically independent. We consider a minimal covariant action consisting of the Einstein--Hilbert term, a unit timelike vector field subject to a normalization constraint, and minimally coupled matter. Without assuming Lorentz invariance, geodesic motion, or the equivalence principle , we demonstrate that all three arise as necessary consequences of diffeomorphism invariance and the variational structure of the theory. We prove that local kinematics reduce to special relativity in the tangent space at every spacetime point, yielding the standard Lorentz factor $$. We further show that the field equations take the Einstein form with a covariantly conserved total stress--energy tensor, and that the universality of free fall follows directly from minimal coupling and the Bianchi identity. General relativity is recovered as a consistent sector of the theory, while controlled deviations are naturally parameterized by the additional timelike sector. These results clarify the minimal structural conditions under which relativistic physics emerges and demonstrate that special-relativistic kinematics, Einstein gravity, and the weak equivalence principle can be unified within a single covariant framework, rather than postulated as independent foundations.

### VAM_0_Analogies

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

This guide provides an accessible, richly illustrated introduction to the Vortex Æther Model (VAM)—a novel framework in physics that reimagines the fabric of reality as a vast, dynamic ocean of superfluid æther. Unlike conventional theories that describe gravity as the bending of spacetime or particles as indivisible points, VAM envisions all matter, energy, and even time itself as emergent from swirling knots, loops, and flows within this universal fluid. Designed for curious laypeople, students, and interdisciplinary thinkers, each section replaces daunting equations with engaging analogies. Readers are invited to picture the universe as a calm pond where every particle is a smoke ring, every force a current, and every moment a ripple on the surface. The guide journeys from ancient philosophical notions of æther through the visions of Maxwell, Kelvin, and Einstein, and into the VAM’s modern reinterpretation—making connections with contemporary fluid dynamics and recent experiments with knotted vortices. Illustrations and sidebars reinforce each metaphor: The guide contrasts VAM’s perspective with that of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, highlighting how shifting from geometry to flow can open new ways of thinking—and new possibilities for experiment and discovery. Above all, this work demonstrates the transformative power of analogies: not only as learning tools, but as springboards for imagination, insight, and the next generation of scientific breakthroughs.

### VAM_13_Beyond_Spacetime_Gravity_time_Vorticity

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

This document presents a mathematical treatment of vorticity and time structure within the framework of the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), a fluid-dynamic reformulation of gravitation and temporal evolution. It introduces the core vorticity equation in natural coordinates, derived from the dynamics of an incompressible, inviscid æther medium. By interpreting vorticity as a measure of atomic clock delay, we couple swirl energy to experienced time and obtain expressions for vorticity in terms of local velocity gradients and flow curvature. The appendices develop key substructures of VAM, including the topological and energetic conditions that trigger irreversible events, called , where the flow evolution becomes non-analytic. These singularities partition æther-time into epochs and correspond to phenomena such as vortex reconnection, swirl pressure rupture, or helicity discontinuities. Each temporal mode— (\( \)), (\( (\( S(t) \)), and (\( T_v \))—is formally defined and related to physical vortex observables. Altogether, this work formulates a temporally stratified æther theory with experimentally testable dynamics, replacing spacetime curvature with a framework in which time dilation and mass-energy interactions emerge from structured vorticity fields. The derivations build upon the classical foundations laid by Helmholtz's theory of vortex invariants~, Maxwell's fluid-based model of electromagnetic stress~, and subsequent developments in shear-layer vorticity and planetary flow dynamics~.

### VAM_14_Topological_Fluid_Dynamics_Lagrangian

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

We present a unified topological-fluid framework grounded in the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), aimed at deriving the inertial mass of Standard Model (SM) particles and constructing a Lagrangian that incorporates electromagnetism, gravity, and extensions toward the strong and weak nuclear forces. Mass is modeled not as an intrinsic property, but as an emergent effect of quantized vorticity, knot topology, and ætheric swirl energy. Building upon prior derivations using the maximum ætheric force $F_{$, vortex core radius $r_c$, Planck time $t_p$, and tangential swirl velocity $C_e$, we propose a family of mass formulas indexed by topological invariants such as the linking number $L_k$ and torus knot parameters $(p,q)$. We explore how trefoil ($T(2,3)$), figure-eight, and higher-order knots encode distinct energy densities and pressure equilibria in an incompressible superfluid medium, allowing quantitative predictions of the masses of the electron, proton, neutron, and neutral knot candidates. The vortex-induced Lagrangians include both Bernoulli and Biot--Savart dynamics, extended by spontaneous symmetry-breaking terms suggestive of Yang--Mills gauge structure. Finally, we propose a knot-periodic correspondence model where elemental families (e.g., reactive nonmetals, noble gases) emerge from quantized toroidal knot classes, providing a new topological lens on the periodic table.

### VAM_15_Quantum_Gravity

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

We present a unified reformulation of quantum mechanics and gravitation within the Vortex Æther Model (VAM) — a framework in which all known particles and fields emerge as topologically stable excitations in a compressible, inviscid superfluid medium. In this approach, wavefunctions correspond to rotating swirl-phase patterns of knotted vortices, and canonical commutation relations arise from the interplay between fluid density and circulation. We derive the Schrödinger equation from first principles as a nonlinear limit of æther-phase evolution, establish a fluid-dynamic analog of the uncertainty principle, and interpret spin-½ behavior as a topological phase acquired under 4π rotation of chiral knots. Gravitational effects emerge from pressure gradients and swirl-induced curvature in the æther, replacing spacetime curvature with vortex geometry. We demonstrate that black hole thermodynamics, including Hawking-like radiation and entropy bounds, follow from quantum-swirl phase quantization near vortex horizons. By introducing a layered time framework — combining background æther time, local swirl-clock phase, and discrete reconnection (Kairos) transitions — we account for entanglement, measurement collapse, and temporal asymmetry without invoking external observers. The VAM framework recovers key quantum-gravitational phenomena with minimal assumptions and a unified ontology. It suggests new directions for experimental testing in condensed matter systems, predicts the existence of chirality-constrained neutral particles, and proposes fluid-derived values for $

Unlike traditional qubits susceptible to phase noise, VAM ``swirlbits'' exploit vortex helicity, genus, and linking number to define logical states. We propose an architecture for swirl-clock-based timing, vortex-knot memory, and topological entangling gates, grounded in the physical mechanisms of æther drag and Kelvin wave coupling.

### VAM_17_shorts

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

We reinterpret the Kerr solution of general relativity through the framework of the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), replacing spacetime curvature and singularities with structured swirl fields in an inviscid, incompressible medium. The Kerr frame-dragging term \(g_{t\) is shown to emerge naturally from the circulation \( ^{()} {C_e^2}\) This correspondence allows us to model the rotating gravitational field of a compact object as a physical æther vortex with well-defined energy, swirl, and pressure gradients. We compare the VAM tensor formulation to the Einstein tensor of the Kerr metric and establish the conditions under which they produce similar observational effects. This work extends prior VAM formulations .

**Title:** Abstract

**Abstract:**

In this work, I explore time dilation within a three-dimensional superfluid Æther framework, where gravity and relativistic effects emerge from the internal motion of the Æther itself. The model treats the Æther as a compressible, inviscid medium threaded with vortex cores, whose rotation and flow patterns influence local time rates.

### VAM_20_String_Theory

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

is an effective field theory in which matter and interactions arise from knotted swirl strings embedded in a condensed vacuum with a preferred foliation. Relativistic symmetry emerges in the subspace orthogonal to a clock field \(T(x)\): we enforce \(u_=g_{+u_\) with field strength \(H_{=B_{\) to a non-Abelian swirl gauge sector with connection \(__{\). Covariant constraints maintain alignment with \(T(x)\). A topological term \(_{}^{\) enforces helicity quantization and stabilizes knotted configurations. Masses enter through a calibrated functional fixed by condensate scales and knot invariants; at leading order we fit the constants on \((e^-,p,n)\) and predict the remaining fermion rest masses without introducing free Yukawa parameters. The construction makes explicit contact with analogue-gravity and topological-soliton frameworks via the \(H=dB\) sector and helicity-based stability.

### VAM_2_Swirl_Clocks

**Title:** Swirl Clocks and Vorticity-Induced Gravity\\[0.25em]

**Abstract:**

This paper presents a fluid-dynamic reformulation of General Relativity using the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), wherein gravity and time dilation arise from vorticity-induced pressure gradients in an incompressible, inviscid superfluid æther. Within a Euclidean 3D space governed by an absolute causal time $$ (Aithēr-Time), mass and inertia emerge as topologically stable vortex knots. Geodesic motion is replaced by alignment along vortex streamlines with conserved circulation, and gravitational force is modeled as a Bernoulli pressure potential \( ) = - \, \|()\|^2 \). Time dilation is reinterpreted as an energetic effect of swirl phase and vortex pressure gradients. The measurable proper time ${r_c^2 c^2} e^{-r/r_c}$. VAM introduces a multilayered temporal ontology, distinguishing absolute causal time ($$), local proper time ($ by embedding them in a consistent, vortex-based æther ontology.

### VAM_4_General_Relativity_from_Structured_Swirl

**Title:** Lorentz Recovery Theorem in the Vortex Æther Model

**Abstract:**

We present a unified derivation showing that both Special and General Relativity emerge as effective limiting behaviors of the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), a fluid-dynamic theory with absolute time and Euclidean space. In the low-vorticity limit, we formally recover the Lorentz-invariant observables of Special Relativity—time dilation, length contraction, and invariant intervals—as consequences of swirl field kinematics, establishing the Lorentz Recovery Theorem. Extending to curved swirl topologies, we demonstrate that key gravitational phenomena of General Relativity—including redshift, light deflection, and geodesic motion—arise from structured vorticity and pressure gradients in a compressible, inviscid æther. This suggests that spacetime curvature is not fundamental, but an emergent epiphenomenon of coherent vortex dynamics in a deeper fluid substratum.

### VAM_5_Lagrangian_Gravity_Electromagnetism

**Title:** On a Vortex-Based Lagrangian Unification of Gravity and Electromagnetism: From Knotted Æther Vorticity to Standard Model Reconstruction using Swirlclock Dynamics, Topological Charge, and Emergent Mass.\\

**Abstract:**

We present the Vortex ther Model (VAM), a fluid-dynamical reformulation of gravitation and the Standard Model based on structured vorticity in an incompressible, inviscid superfluid æther. Unlike spacetime curvature or abstract gauge fields, VAM attributes mass, charge, and spin to topologically stable vortex knots and their circulation in a flat Euclidean space with absolute time. Fundamental particles emerge as quantized solitons—trefoils, torus knots, and Hopf links—governed by a unified vorticity Lagrangian. Gravitational interaction arises from swirl-induced pressure gradients; electromagnetic fields are encoded in helicity and chirality of vortex structures. We introduce a Hamilton–Jacobi formulation based on the swirlclock phase \( S(, t) \), recovering quantization from circulation integrals and deriving a Schrödinger-like wave equation directly from vortex phase dynamics. Phase continuity enforces quantized circulation, while topological interference yields de Broglie relations and vortex-based duality. Temporal phenomena—such as time dilation, neutrino oscillations, and $T$-violation—are interpreted as swirlclock decoherence across layered temporal modes. Using a topological master formula, we derive fermion rest masses from vortex energy with sub-percent accuracy for the proton, neutron, and electron. Together, these results demonstrate that known physical observables can be recovered from coherent vorticity dynamics without invoking curved spacetime or quantum postulates. VAM provides a physically grounded, mathematically coherent foundation for unification.

We present a reformulation of the Standard Model Lagrangian within the dimensional and topological framework of the Vortex Æther Model (VAM). In this approach, conventional quantum field terms are reinterpreted via fluid-mechanical analogs: particles correspond to knotted vortex excitations in a compressible æther, while interactions arise from swirl dynamics, circulation, and density fluctuations. The model replaces Planck-based constants with a complete set of natural units derived from mechanical quantities such as core radius (\(r_c\)), swirl velocity (\(C_e\)), and maximum æther force (\(F^_\)).

### VAM_7_From_Quantum_Constants_to_Galactic_Swirl

**Title:** (Not found)

**Abstract:**

This paper presents a first-principles derivation of the æther density within the Vortex ther Model (VAM)—a topological fluid-dynamic framework in which gravity, inertia, and quantum behavior emerge from structured vorticity in an inviscid, compressible medium. We derive the æther’s mass density \( }^{} \) and rotational energy density \( }^{} \) without circular dependence on empirical gravitational constants. By anchoring the characteristic vorticity \( \) to the electron’s Compton frequency, scaled by the fine-structure constant \( }^{} = {{ \, ^3 \] This value matches vacuum energy estimates and vorticity energy densities from both cosmology and quantum fluid analogs. We further construct a two-component swirl velocity profile—combining a finite-core vortex solution with a saturating ætheric tail—which yields a closed-form expression for galactic rotation curves without invoking dark matter or MOND interpolation. The resulting profile predicts long-range vorticity-induced acceleration, ætheric pressure gradients, swirl-based time dilation, and quantized circulation surfaces. This formulation bridges microscopic and galactic scales through shared physical parameters and offers direct falsifiability in both astrophysical and subatomic regimes.

### VAM_8_MASTER_Paper

**Title:** The Vortex Æther Model: \\[1ex]

**Abstract:**

We present the Swirl-String Theory also known as the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), a unified physical framework in which mass, gravity, and proper time emerge from topologically structured vorticity within a compressible, inviscid æther. In contrast to curvature-based relativity and Higgs-based mass generation, VAM describes particles as knotted vortex excitations, and gravity as a swirl-induced time deviation field. The theory reproduces classical phenomena such as gravitational redshift, time dilation, and frame-dragging through fluid-dynamic energetics, and calculates particle masses and physical constants from first principles. The Standard Model gauge groups SU(3), SU(2), and U(1) arise naturally from vortex topology and swirl symmetry, while canonical quantization defines a Fock-like Hilbert space over knot eigenstates. We develop a full path-integral formulation over topological sectors of the æther manifold, enabling quantum transitions, knot fusion, and helicity exchange interactions. Benchmarking against general relativity and experimental tests of gravitational time deviation support the model’s viability. VAM offers a physically grounded, falsifiable, and derivational alternative to conventional quantum gravity and field theory models.\\ Inside baryons, three quark knots (e.g., $5_2$, $5_2$, $6_1$; see Figs.~ and ) meet at a Y-shaped junction, forming a single composite swirl tube (Fig.~).

**Title:** Electromagnetic Swirl Coil Experiment in the Vortex Æther Model: \ Three-Phase Construction, Modeling, and Gravitational Lift Prediction

**Abstract:**

We present a theoretical experiment exploring gravitational lift from a three-phase “swirl coil” within the Vortex Æther Model (VAM). A specialized 3-phase electromagnetic coil is constructed as a 32-point polygonal winding with a chiral skip pattern (+11, –9) to induce structured vorticity in an idealized superfluid æther. We model the coil’s magnetic field via the Biot–Savart law and interpret it as a circulating aether flow (vorticity field) according to VAM’s swirl-gauge correspondence. Pulsed 3-phase excitation (both 50\% duty and an asymmetric $$ in the incompressible, inviscid æther. From these, we compute the local gravity field $() = -{}$ and predict the net upward impulse (lift) generated by the coil’s swirl. In a VAM vacuum (superfluid æther of density^{()} = 7 $ kg/m$^3$ (, Sec.~6.2), which defines the default physical density of the superfluid æther. This provides the scaling factor required to convert normalized gravitational field values into physical units of force or acceleration.\\% % (Comment: Sets the unit system for converting simulated swirl-pressure gradients into real Newtonian impulse)% } $}$~kg/m$^3$) the simulations predict a small but finite gravity-like force opposing the local weight. For comparison, an air-medium simulation is included to distinguish true ætheric lift from mere aerodynamic or electromagnetic forces. The paper is organized into Introduction, Methods, Coil Design, Simulation Results, Swirl Gravity Derivation, Discussion, and Conclusion. We aim to establish a lab-testable prediction: a properly driven three-phase coil can produce a discernible gravitational lift via structured aether vorticity, thus providing experimental validation for electroswirl propulsion under VAM principles.
