+\section{Numerical Benchmarks (Main-Text Summary)}
+\label{sec:v075-benchmarks}
+
+To separate genuinely predictive content from fitted ``consistency closure'',
+we summarize two evaluation modes:
+(A) a \emph{predictive} mode anchored only by a single electron calibration,
+and (B) an \emph{exact-closure} mode in which baryon-sector geometric factors
+are fixed to reproduce $p$ and $n$ exactly. Full benchmark tables and derivation
+details remain in the Appendix.

+$\mu$ & 105.6583745 & \dots & \dots & A & (e.g.\ $T(2,5)$) \\

+\section{Scalar Clock Field Visualization}
+\label{sec:v075-chi-figure}
+
+As an explicit visualization of the scalar clock field $\chi(x)$ in a $2$D slice,
we include a representative contour plot with $\mathbf{g}=-\nabla \chi$ overlaid.
This figure is intended as a \emph{presentation anchor} (replace with your SST
source profile or simulation output when ready).

+\section{Condensed Replies to Philosophical Objections}
+\label{sec:v075-philosophy}
+
+In the interest of readability, each philosophical objection is addressed here
+in a single paragraph (claim $\rightarrow$ SST response $\rightarrow$ falsifiable
+consequence). Extended discussions are moved to Appendix~\ref{app:expanded-philosophy}.
+
+\paragraph{Objection: ``Hydrodynamics is merely analogy.''}
+SST treats the effective incompressible medium as the \emph{primary} ontology,
+with observables tied to conserved currents and coarse-grained invariants rather
+than to point-particle axioms. The falsifiable content is the existence of a
+well-defined far-field momentum flux carried by the clock/foliation sector and
+the associated monopole solution that reproduces an inverse-square law in the
+appropriate limit.
+
+\paragraph{Objection: ``Topology cannot explain quantum discreteness.''}
+Discreteness enters through admissible knot classes and stability selection
+via an effective energy functional over embeddings. A falsifiable consequence is
+that transitions correspond to topology-changing processes with selection rules
+constraining allowed channels; these can be mapped to spectroscopic patterns once
+the effective functional is fixed.
+
+\paragraph{Objection: ``The construction is underdetermined.''}
+The framework is deliberately modular: kinematics (incompressible flow + invariants)
+is fixed, while dynamics is specified by a minimal EFT for the clock/foliation and
+multi-director sectors. Underdetermination is reduced by demanding (i) correct
+Newtonian and QED limits, (ii) internal consistency with benchmark mass ratios,
+and (iii) quantitative predictions for at least one nontrivial observable per sector.
+
+
+\section{Gauge Mapping and Mixing Angles}
+\label{sec:v075-mixing}
+
+The emergence of a minimal $\mathrm{SU}(3)\times\mathrm{SU}(2)\times\mathrm{U}(1)$
+structure from a multi-director sector should be accompanied by an explicit statement
+of what is \emph{predictable} versus what remains \emph{to be fixed} in v0.7.5.
+At the level of an effective electroweak sector with couplings $(g,g')$, the standard
+relations read
+\begin{equation}
+\tan\theta_W=\frac{g'}{g},
+\qquad
+\sin^2\theta_W=\frac{g'^2}{g^2+g'^2}.
+\end{equation}
+In SST language, $g$ and $g'$ are expected to be functions of the corresponding
+director-field stiffnesses / elastic moduli. Thus, $\theta_W$ is \emph{predictable
+in principle} once the minimal quadratic EFT coefficients are specified and matched
+to a benchmark set.
+
+By contrast, CKM/PMNS mixing requires an explicit flavor-basis choice (knot-class
+dictionary) and an interaction Hamiltonian generating a non-diagonal mass matrix;
+mixing angles then follow from diagonalization. v0.7.5 should therefore present a
+short roadmap: (i) define the basis, (ii) write the interaction terms, (iii) state
+which entries are fixed by symmetry and which are phenomenological inputs, and (iv)
+identify at least one testable cross-sector correlation.
