  "description": "Nonlinear delayed-feedback systems can display spatio--temporal organization even when governed by a single scalar delay differential equation. Building on the long-delay spatio--temporal analogy , we argue that delay-induced pattern formation can act as a generic classical mechanism for  in circulating nonlinear loops. In this perspective, the finite loop transit time defines an effective pseudo-spatial coordinate on which modulational instabilities and front dynamics can select robust plateau-like states. Using a minimal cubic delayed-feedback model as a representative system, we outline how multistability of plateau configurations can be interpreted as discrete circulation patterns in the long-delay regime. We emphasize the scope and limitations of this interpretation, and we distinguish schematic illustration from reproducible numerical evidence.",
