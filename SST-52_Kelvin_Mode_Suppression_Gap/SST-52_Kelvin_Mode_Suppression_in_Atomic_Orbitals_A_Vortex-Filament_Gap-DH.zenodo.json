  "description": "<div>\n<pre>In hydrodynamic models where electrons are represented by closed vortex filaments in an incompressible medium, atomic orbitals arise as equilibrium configurations. A key consistency issue is whether internal Kelvin-wave excitations could add thermodynamic corrections large enough to destabilize the hydrogenic spectrum. We show that, absent additional structure, such corrections would exceed spectroscopic bounds by many orders of magnitude. A topological excitation gap in the Kelvin spectrum&mdash;of order \\(\\mathcal{O}(10^2\\text{--}10^3\\,\\mathrm{eV})\\)&mdash;naturally suppresses these effects. In this regime, the Schr\\\"odinger equation functions as a low-energy equation of state, while Kelvin dynamics are inert except under extreme acceleration or high-energy conditions. This separation of scales resolves a central constraint on vortex-filament descriptions of atomic structure.%</pre>\n</div>",
