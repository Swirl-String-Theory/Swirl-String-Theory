# SST Transport Reproducibility Package

Version: 2025-10-27T21:30:05Z

This package accompanies the manuscript:

> Electron–Swirl Coupled Transport in Swirl–String Theory (SST): Perturbative Solutions, Quantitative Benchmarks, and Falsifiable Experiments

It contains machine-readable constants, benchmarks, and two minimal notebooks.

## Contents
- `constants.csv` — canonical SI constants and derived scales (Omega_0, rho_E).
- `benchmarks.csv` — parameters and results for scenarios B1/B2 in the paper.
- `kappaC_validation.ipynb` — validates the coherence contribution structure and Lorentzian detuning factor.
- `noise_budget_3sigma.ipynb` — demonstrates detectability estimates vs NETD and averaging.
- `env.yml` — minimal conda environment for exact reruns.
