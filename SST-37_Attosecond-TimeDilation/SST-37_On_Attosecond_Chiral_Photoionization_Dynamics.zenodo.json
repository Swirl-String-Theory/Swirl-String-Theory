  "description": "<div>\n<pre>Han et al. (Nature, 2025) report enantiomer-dependent photoemission delays in gas-phase methyloxirane, with angle-resolved values reaching \\SI{240}{\\atto\\second}. Here we sketch an interpretation in the Swirl--String Theory (SST) picture, where chirality carries a local, direction-sensitive time rate (&ldquo;Swirl Clock&rdquo;). Simple estimates map the reported delays to &Aring;-scale effective path differences for the outgoing electron. While this is not a unique explanation&mdash;Coulomb&ndash;laser coupling and continuum&ndash;continuum phases remain plausible contributors&mdash;the SST view organizes the observations into a single, testable statement: reversing the Swirl Clock orientation should flip the forward/backward delay. We outline measurements that could falsify the proposal and note where present assumptions are likely to break.</pre>\n<div>\n<pre><strong>Code availability:</strong> The file SST-Proof_Chiral_Photoionization.py reproduces Table and Fig. </pre>\n</div>\n</div>",
