  "description": "\n        I summarize the SST constants and bounds that fix the scale of any effect and then outline three classes of control:\n        (i) modulating strength by adding or countering circulation;\n        (ii) imposing directionality by aligning structures, phasing oscillations, or using bulk rotation; and\n        (iii) attempting shielding, reflection or redirection by topological and dynamical means.\n        For each, I discuss feasibility, energetic thresholds, and SST's built-in maximum-force limit.\n        A key falsifiable prediction highlighted here is that any topological change to the swirl network that modifies gravitational coupling must co-emit a discrete electromagnetic impulse of fixed magnitude.\n        The overall conclusion is conservative: macroscopic ``gravity control'' demands energy densities that push against SST's own limits, yet small, testable effects may be accessible in superfluid or Bose--Einstein--condensate analogs.",
