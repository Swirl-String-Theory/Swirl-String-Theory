  "description": "We present a unified field theory based on the hydrodynamics of an inviscid, incompressible, director-bearing fluid substrate. We demonstrate that Relativistic kinematic effects emerge naturally from circulation conservation: proper time dilation is derived as a function of fluid circulation , while effective mass arises from rotational kinetic energy density . We identify the photon not as a point particle, but as a propagating torsion wave (shear wave) within this substrate, predicting a vacuum Faraday effect  recently supported by experimental data on optical magnetic torques (Assouline & Capua, 2025). Furthermore, we show that steady-swirl Euler pressure gradients yield a short-range \\(1/r^3\\) force for filamentary \\(v_^3\\), , and that the fundamental electron scales (r_e, .",
