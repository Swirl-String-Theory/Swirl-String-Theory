\opening{Dear Editors,}

Please consider the enclosed manuscript entitled
\textbf{“Delay-Induced Mode Selection in Circulating Feedback Systems”}
for publication in \textit{Chaos}.

This work investigates how finite circulation delays in closed feedback loops enforce discrete, stability-selected phase-locked states in a minimal classical framework. Using a reduced phase-oscillator description, we show that \textbf{temporal nonlocality alone—without spatial boundary conditions or microscopic quantization—leads to spectral discreteness through dynamical stability constraints}.

For transparency, a separate manuscript by the same author is currently under review at \textit{AIP Advances}, titled:
\textbf{“Delay-Induced Pattern Formation as a Route to Mode Discreteness in Nonlinear Ring Systems.”}
The two submissions are scientifically distinct and address different regimes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{prior manuscript} explores delay-induced pattern formation in nonlinear rings, where spatial degrees of freedom organize into discrete extended modes.
    \item The \textit{present manuscript} eliminates spatial structure entirely and demonstrates that mode discreteness emerges intrinsically from circulation delay via stability filtering in a reduced model.
\end{itemize}

Key differentiators of the current work include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A focus on \textbf{effective constitutive modeling}, where delay acts as a macroscopic ingredient;
    \item \textbf{Stability-induced discreteness}, rather than emergent spatial patterns;
    \item Conceptual parallels to \textbf{homogenization theory} and \textbf{bianisotropic effective media}, in which hidden nonlocality gives rise to emergent macroscopic structure.
\end{itemize}

There is no overlap in figures, derivations, or text between the two manuscripts. Each is designed to stand independently for readers interested in complementary aspects of delay-induced phenomena.

We believe this contribution will be of particular interest to \textit{Chaos} readers working on delayed feedback, nonlinear oscillators, phase-locking, and effective nonlocal dynamics.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}

    \end{letter}
