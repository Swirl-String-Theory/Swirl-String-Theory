  "description": "Closed circulation loops with finite propagation speeds constitute a generic class of delayed feedback systems. While spatial boundary conditions are traditionally responsible for mode discretization, we argue that temporal circulation delays alone are sufficient to enforce spectral discreteness through dynamical stability. Drawing on analogies with recent advances in bianisotropic homogenization, we derive a minimal phase-oscillator model for a circulating field. We demonstrate that the finite transit time acts as a selection filter, stabilizing a discrete ladder of stability-selected modes without invoking microscopic quantization. These results suggest that delay-induced discreteness is a universal feature of effective field theories in loops, paralleling the emergence of cross-couplings in spatially asymmetric media.",
