  "description": "We develop a falsifiable hydrodynamic extension of field theory in which the vacuum consists of two interacting, incompressible continua: a fast electromagnetic sector with characteristic propagation speed \\(c\\), and a slower rotational Swirl sector with speed \\(|\\,\\)m/s. Using Helmholtz--Kelvin vortex dynamics, we show that acceleration excites vorticity stretching rather than compression, producing a primary Swirl burst with characteristic delay \\( \\), this burst dissipates non-radiatively, leaving a secondary photon ``Unruh Echo'' at ",
