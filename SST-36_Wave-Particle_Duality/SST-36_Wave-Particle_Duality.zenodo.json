  "description": "We present a Swirl--String Theory (SST) interpretation of the electron’s wave--particle duality based on Canon v0.3.1. The electron is modeled as a swirl-string admitting two phases: an unknotted, delocalized toroidal circulation \\[ (wave-like) and a localized, knotted soliton (trefoil) \\] (particle-like). We define an effective energy functional including bulk swirl density, line tension, near-contact interactions, and helicity terms. Photon-induced transitions \\( \\) occur at resonant frequencies determined by impedance matching between electromagnetic modes and topological excitations. We show how circulation quantization on \\[ recovers de Broglie wave relations, while \\] provides a stable, localized excitation. This framework yields falsifiable predictions in atomic absorption spectra, Rydberg scaling, and polarization-dependent selection rules.",
