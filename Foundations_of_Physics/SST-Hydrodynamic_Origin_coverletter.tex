\begin{letter}{Editors\\\textit{Foundations of Physics}}
    \opening{Dear Editor,}

    I am pleased to submit the manuscript \textit{The Hydrodynamic Triad: Unifying Gravity, Electromagnetism, and Quantum Mass via a Circulation-Based Vacuum Canon} for consideration in \textit{Foundations of Physics}.

    Standard Model parameters and gravitational constants are typically treated as arbitrary empirical inputs. In this work, we present a rigorous derivation of these constants from a fundamental hydrodynamic substrate defined by a single topological invariant: the Circulation Quantum $\Gamma$. By establishing a "Circulation-First" canon based on the triad of vacuum density $\rho_f$, wave speed $c$, and circulation $\Gamma$, we demonstrate that the electron mass $m_e$, the fine structure constant $\alpha$, and Newton's gravitational constant $G$ emerge as geometric consequences of knotted vorticity in an inviscid, incompressible fluid.

    \textbf{Key foundational advances presented in this work include:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{The Topological Origin of Mass:} We show that particle rest masses are not intrinsic but solitonic, derived from the energy density of knotted vortex filaments (specifically the $3_1$, $5_2$, and $6_1$ topologies) scaled by the hyperbolic volume of their knot complements.
        \item \textbf{Resolution of the Hierarchy Problem:} We derive the gravitational coupling $G$ directly from the strong-force scale of the vortex core, identifying the geometric suppression factor ($\lambda_G \approx 10^{-60}$) that naturally separates quantum and cosmological scales without fine-tuning.
        \item \textbf{Hydrodynamic Origin of Quantum Numbers:} We provide a geometric map where electric charge, spin, and color correspond to specific topological linking numbers and chirality states of the vortex strings.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Why \textit{Foundations of Physics}?}
    This manuscript addresses the deep ontological questions central to your journal's mission. It proposes a realist, geometric unification that bridges the conceptual gap between fluid mechanics, knot theory, and gauge theory. Beyond theoretical synthesis, the framework offers a concrete experimental discriminator: the \textbf{Vacuum Verdet Constant}, which predicts a unique linear-in-$B$ magneto-optic effect in the vacuum, distinct from standard QED predictions.

    \textbf{Compliance.}
    The manuscript is original, not under consideration elsewhere, and all authorship/affiliation information is complete. Conflicts of interest: none. Data, code, and the formal derivation canon are available via the cited Zenodo record(s).

    Thank you for your consideration.

    \closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
