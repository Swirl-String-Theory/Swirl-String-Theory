    \section{Introduction}

        Classical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics provide a remarkably successful macroscopic
        description of fluids and radiation. The equation of state of an ideal gas,
        \begin{equation}
            P V = N k_{\mathrm B} T,
        \end{equation}
        and the relation between pressure and energy density for an isotropic radiation field,
        \begin{equation}
            P = \frac{1}{3} u(T),
        \end{equation}
        are textbook results derived from kinetic arguments and from the stress--energy tensor of
        relativistic fields~\cite{LandauLifshitz_StatPhys,Reif,LandauLifshitz_Fields}.
        At the same time, the classical Rayleigh--Jeans treatment of thermal radiation predicts
        $u(T) \propto T\,\omega_{\max}^2$, diverging as the high-frequency cutoff $\omega_{\max}\to\infty$.
        The resolution of this ``ultraviolet catastrophe'' by Planck's quantization of oscillator
        energies is one of the historical starting points of quantum theory~\cite{Planck1901,Rayleigh1900,Jeans1905}.

        In parallel with these developments, classical vortex dynamics has established that
        incompressible, inviscid fluids support localized vortical structures---thin vortex rings and
        more general closed vortex loops---with finite energy, impulse, and self-induced translational
        velocity~\cite{Batchelor1967,Saffman1992}. In recent work, the present author has summarized
        standard results for the energy and impulse of thin vortex loops and emphasized their
        ``particle-like'' attributes in purely classical Euler flow~\cite{Iskandarani2025_VortexLoops}.
        A closed filament of circulation $\Gamma$ and core size $a$ carries a finite kinetic energy
        $E(\Gamma,R,a)$, an impulse $\boldsymbol{I}$, and an effective mass
        $M_{\mathrm{eff}} = \|\boldsymbol{I}\|/U$, where $U$ is the self-induced velocity along the loop axis.
        The existence of such finite-energy, localized structures invites the question of how far
        one can push a classical ``vortex-particle'' picture within standard continuum mechanics.

        A second, complementary observation is that kinetic energy in extended media contributes to
        inertia and gravitational mass through the relativistic relation $E = mc^2$.
        While this statement is encoded in the stress--energy tensor of relativistic fluids,
        explicit examples in simple incompressible configurations remain pedagogically useful.
        In Ref.~\cite{Iskandarani2025_RotKE}, an incompressible, inviscid fluid undergoing rigid-body
        rotation in a finite cylinder was analyzed, and the volume-averaged rotational kinetic energy
        density $\langle e_{\mathrm{kin}}\rangle$ was related to an effective mass density
        $\Delta \rho_{\mathrm{eff}} = \langle e_{\mathrm{kin}}\rangle /c^2$ in the nonrelativistic limit.
        For that geometry one finds the compact result
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{\Delta \rho_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\rho}
            = \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{v_{\mathrm{edge}}}{c}\right)^2,
        \end{equation}
        where $v_{\mathrm{edge}}$ is the tangential speed at the cylinder boundary and $\rho$ is the
        rest-mass density. This example shows, within standard special relativity, how rotational
        motion modifies the effective mass density of an incompressible medium at order $(v/c)^2$.

        The purpose of the present paper is to combine these two strands---finite-energy vortex loops
        and effective mass density from rotational kinetic energy---and to explore the thermodynamics
        of a dilute gas of vortex loops in an incompressible, inviscid fluid.
        Our analysis is entirely classical and remains within the framework of Eulerian fluid mechanics,
        special relativity, and textbook statistical mechanics. We show that:

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A gas of weakly interacting, randomly oriented vortex loops with fixed circulation
            and core size admits a kinetic description in which the usual ideal-gas equation of
            state $PV = N k_{\mathrm B} T$ is recovered from the momentum flux, without any
            modification of Boltzmann's constant or of the definition of temperature.

            \item For an isotropic ensemble of ultra-relativistic or effectively massless excitations
            built from such loops, the standard relation $P = \tfrac{1}{3}u$ follows from the
            three-dimensional structure of the momentum flux tensor, in direct analogy with
            the radiation case.

            \item The mechanical spectrum of admissible loop configurations is effectively bounded from
            above in frequency by the combination of finite core radius, finite circulation, and
            a characteristic swirl speed, so that the classical Rayleigh--Jeans integral for the
            energy density remains finite when evaluated over this mechanically constrained mode
            set. No modification of Maxwell's equations or of the relativistic field equations is
            assumed; the regularization arises from the kinematics of the vortex degrees of freedom.
        \end{enumerate}

        From a thermodynamic standpoint, the main result is thus that a purely classical,
        incompressible fluid with vortex-loop microstructure can reproduce the familiar
        pressure--volume--temperature relations and the $P = \tfrac{1}{3}u$ relation for an isotropic
        radiation-like gas, while avoiding the ultraviolet divergence of the naive continuum mode
        counting. From a conceptual standpoint, the construction provides a concrete mechanical model
        in which the energy, pressure, and effective mass associated with internal rotational motion
        can be treated on the same footing as in relativistic continuum mechanics, without invoking
        any nonstandard dynamics or postulates beyond those already present in classical fluid
        mechanics and special relativity.

    \section{Vortex-loop gas and kinetic theory}
        \label{sec:vortex-gas}

        In this section we set up a minimal kinetic model for a dilute gas of vortex loops
        in an incompressible, inviscid fluid and derive its thermodynamic equation of state.
        The construction follows standard kinetic theory, with the only nonstandard ingredient
        being the identification of the microscopic ``particles'' with finite-energy vortex
        loops in Euler flow.

        \subsection{Vortex-loop kinematics and effective mass}

            We consider a homogeneous, incompressible, inviscid fluid of density $\rho_f$,
            described by the Euler equations
            \begin{equation}
                \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{v}}{\partial t}
                + (\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{v}
                = -\frac{1}{\rho_f}\nabla p,
                \qquad
                \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{v} = 0,
                \label{eq:Euler}
            \end{equation}
            where $\boldsymbol{v}(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ is the velocity field and $p(\boldsymbol{x},t)$
            the pressure. Vorticity is defined as
            \begin{equation}
                \boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla\times\boldsymbol{v}.
            \end{equation}
            We assume that vorticity is confined to thin tubes (vortex filaments) of core radius $a$,
            within which the tangential speed is bounded by a characteristic value $v_0$, and that the
            flow outside the cores is irrotational.

            Classical vortex dynamics shows that a closed vortex filament of circulation $\Gamma$
            and large-scale radius $R \gg a$ has finite kinetic energy $E(\Gamma,R,a)$, finite
            impulse $\boldsymbol{I}$, and a self-induced translational velocity $U$ along its symmetry
            axis~\cite{Batchelor1967,Saffman1992,Iskandarani2025_VortexLoops}. It is natural to define
            an effective mass
            \begin{equation}
                M_{\mathrm{eff}} \equiv \frac{\|\boldsymbol{I}\|}{U},
                \label{eq:Meff-def}
            \end{equation}
            so that the loop behaves kinematically like a particle of mass $M_{\mathrm{eff}}$ moving
            with velocity $U$ along its axis. In addition to this translational motion, the fluid
            inside and near the core carries internal rotational kinetic energy. In the nonrelativistic
            regime, the contribution of this internal energy to the effective mass density can be
            expressed, following Ref.~\cite{Iskandarani2025_RotKE}, as
            \begin{equation}
                \Delta \rho_{\mathrm{eff}} = \frac{\langle e_{\mathrm{kin}}\rangle}{c^2},
                \label{eq:Delta-rho-eff}
            \end{equation}
            where $\langle e_{\mathrm{kin}}\rangle$ is the volume-averaged rotational kinetic energy
            density and $c$ is the speed of light.

            In what follows, we treat each vortex loop as a structure with fixed circulation and
            core size, whose internal degrees of freedom are either frozen or accounted for as a
            fixed contribution to $M_{\mathrm{eff}}$. The centre-of-mass motion of the loops then
            admits a standard kinetic description.

        \subsection{Phase space and Hamiltonian}

            We consider $N$ well-separated vortex loops in a container of volume $V$.
            Let $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ and $\boldsymbol{p}_i$ denote the centre-of-mass position and
            momentum of the $i$-th loop ($i=1,\dots,N$). In the dilute limit we neglect mutual
            induction and other interactions between loops, so that the total Hamiltonian factorizes:
            \begin{equation}
                H = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\boldsymbol{p}_i^2}{2M_{\mathrm{eff}}}.
                \label{eq:H-nonrel}
            \end{equation}
            The phase space is the usual $6N$-dimensional space of coordinates and momenta,
            \begin{equation}
                \Gamma = \left\{ (\boldsymbol{x}_1,\dots,\boldsymbol{x}_N;\,
                             \boldsymbol{p}_1,\dots,\boldsymbol{p}_N) \right\},
            \end{equation}
            endowed with the Liouville measure
            \begin{equation}
                \mathrm{d}\mu(\Gamma)
                = \prod_{i=1}^{N} \mathrm{d}^3x_i\,\mathrm{d}^3p_i.
            \end{equation}
            Importantly, the incompressibility constraint $\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{v}=0$ is imposed
            at the level of the underlying Euler flow and affects the detailed form of
            $M_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and the internal energy of each loop. It does not modify the
            Liouville measure or the Hamiltonian structure for the centre-of-mass coordinates,
            which remain those of a dilute gas of classical particles.

        \subsection{Canonical ensemble and partition function}

            We now place the vortex-loop gas in contact with a heat bath at temperature $T$ and
            describe it within the canonical ensemble. The canonical partition function is
            \begin{equation}
                Z_N(T,V)
                = \frac{1}{N!\,h^{3N}}
                \int \exp[-\beta H]\,
                \mathrm{d}^{3N}p\,\mathrm{d}^{3N}x,
                \qquad \beta = \frac{1}{k_{\mathrm B}T},
                \label{eq:ZN-def}
            \end{equation}
            where $h$ is Planck's constant and $k_{\mathrm B}$ Boltzmann's constant.
            Inserting the Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:H-nonrel},
            \begin{equation}
                Z_N(T,V)
                = \frac{1}{N!\,h^{3N}}
                \prod_{i=1}^{N}
                \left[
                    \int_{V} \mathrm{d}^3x_i
                    \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \exp\!\left(
                                                  -\beta\frac{\boldsymbol{p}_i^2}{2M_{\mathrm{eff}}}
                \right)\mathrm{d}^3p_i
                \right].
            \end{equation}
            The position integrals each yield a factor of $V$, and the momentum integrals are
            Gaussian:
            \begin{equation}
                \int_{\mathbb{R}^3}
                \exp\!\left(-\beta\frac{\boldsymbol{p}^2}{2M_{\mathrm{eff}}}\right)
                \mathrm{d}^3p
                = \left( 2\pi M_{\mathrm{eff}} k_{\mathrm B}T \right)^{3/2}.
            \end{equation}
            Hence
            \begin{equation}
                Z_N(T,V)
                = \frac{1}{N!}
                \left[
                    \frac{V}{\lambda_T^3}
                \right]^{\!N},
                \qquad
                \lambda_T
                = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2\pi M_{\mathrm{eff}} k_{\mathrm B}T}},
                \label{eq:ZN-final}
            \end{equation}
            where $\lambda_T$ is the thermal de Broglie wavelength associated with $M_{\mathrm{eff}}$.
            This is the standard partition function of a classical ideal gas with mass
            $M_{\mathrm{eff}}$; the vortex nature of the underlying structures is encoded entirely
            in the value of $M_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and in possible internal-state degeneracies, which
            we neglect here.

        \subsection{Ideal-gas equation of state}

            The Helmholtz free energy $F(T,V,N)$ is
            \begin{equation}
                F(T,V,N)
                = -k_{\mathrm B}T \ln Z_N(T,V)
                = -k_{\mathrm B}T
                \left[
                    -\ln N! + N\ln V - 3N\ln\lambda_T
                \right].
            \end{equation}
            The pressure is obtained in the usual way as
            \begin{equation}
                P
                = -\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial V}\right)_{T,N}
                = k_{\mathrm B}T
                \left(\frac{\partial \ln Z_N}{\partial V}\right)_{T,N}
                = k_{\mathrm B}T\,\frac{N}{V}.
                \label{eq:ideal-gas}
            \end{equation}
            Thus the dilute vortex-loop gas obeys the ideal-gas law
            \begin{equation}
                P V = N k_{\mathrm B} T,
            \end{equation}
            with no modification of the equation of state due to the incompressibility of the underlying
            fluid. The incompressibility affects the value of $M_{\mathrm{eff}}$ through the
            kinetic energy of the core and the surrounding flow, but once $M_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is fixed,
            the centre-of-mass dynamics yields the same $P$--$V$--$T$ relation as for point particles.

        \subsection{Isotropic momentum flux and $P = \tfrac{1}{3}u$}

            We now turn to the relation between pressure and energy density for an isotropic ensemble
            of excitations. Consider a gas of particles (here, effective vortex-loop quasiparticles)
            with energies $E$ and momenta $\boldsymbol{p}$, moving with speed $v = |\boldsymbol{v}|$.
            In kinetic theory, the pressure on a plane normal to the $x$-axis is given by the
            momentum flux in the $x$-direction,
            \begin{equation}
                P
                = \frac{1}{V}
                \left\langle \sum_{i} p_{x,i} v_{x,i} \right\rangle,
            \end{equation}
            where the average is over all particles in the volume $V$ and $p_{x,i}$, $v_{x,i}$ are
            the $x$-components of the momentum and velocity of particle $i$.
            For an isotropic distribution, one can write
            \begin{equation}
                p_{x} v_{x} = (\boldsymbol{p}\cdot\boldsymbol{v})\cos^2\theta,
            \end{equation}
            where $\theta$ is the angle between $\boldsymbol{p}$ and the $x$-axis. In three dimensions
            the angular average of $\cos^2\theta$ over the unit sphere is
            \begin{equation}
                \langle \cos^2\theta \rangle
                = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\!\mathrm{d}\phi
                \int_0^\pi \cos^2\theta\,\sin\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta
                = \frac{1}{3}.
            \end{equation}
            Thus,
            \begin{equation}
                P
                = \frac{1}{3V}
                \left\langle \sum_{i} \boldsymbol{p}_i\cdot\boldsymbol{v}_i \right\rangle.
            \end{equation}
            In the ultra-relativistic or effectively massless limit, one has $E_i = c\|\boldsymbol{p}_i\|$
            and $\|\boldsymbol{v}_i\|=c$, so that $\boldsymbol{p}_i\cdot\boldsymbol{v}_i = E_i$.
            The pressure therefore becomes
            \begin{equation}
                P
                = \frac{1}{3V}
                \left\langle \sum_{i} E_i \right\rangle
                = \frac{1}{3} u,
                \label{eq:P-u-1over3}
            \end{equation}
            where
            \begin{equation}
                u
                = \frac{1}{V}\left\langle \sum_{i} E_i \right\rangle
            \end{equation}
            is the energy density. This is the familiar relation for an isotropic gas of massless
            particles or photons~\cite{LandauLifshitz_StatPhys,LandauLifshitz_Fields}.
            In the present context, it applies to any regime in which the relevant vortex-loop
            excitations propagate at speeds close to $c$ and their energy is dominated by
            translational motion rather than rest energy.

            The crucial point is that Eq.~\eqref{eq:P-u-1over3} follows entirely from the
            three-dimensional isotropy of the momentum distribution and the kinematics of
            relativistic particles. It does not depend on the detailed microstructure of the
            underlying medium. The vortex-loop picture provides a concrete classical realization
            of such excitations within incompressible Euler flow; the relation $P = \tfrac{1}{3}u$
            then follows from standard kinetic arguments applied to these effective degrees of freedom.

            \medskip

            In summary, a dilute gas of vortex loops in an incompressible, inviscid fluid admits
            a standard kinetic description in which the ideal-gas law and the radiation-like
            relation $P = \tfrac{1}{3}u$ emerge in precisely the same way as for point particles
            and photons in conventional kinetic theory. The incompressibility of the underlying
            fluid constrains the internal structure and effective mass of the loops, but does not
            alter the macroscopic $P$--$V$--$T$ relations obtained from their centre-of-mass motion
            and isotropic momentum flux.


    \section{Mechanically allowed mode set and the classical ultraviolet problem}
        \label{sec:modes-UV}

        The derivation of the Rayleigh--Jeans law in a cavity rests on two ingredients:
        (i) the normal-mode structure of Maxwell's equations in a finite volume, and
        (ii) the assumption that each normal mode behaves as an independent harmonic oscillator
        carrying an average energy $k_{\mathrm B}T$ in the classical limit.
        The number of electromagnetic modes with angular frequency between $\omega$ and
        $\omega+\mathrm{d}\omega$ in a volume $V$ is~\cite{LandauLifshitz_Fields}
        \begin{equation}
            g_{\mathrm{EM}}(\omega)\,\mathrm{d}\omega
            = \frac{V}{\pi^2 c^3}\,\omega^2\,\mathrm{d}\omega,
            \label{eq:g-EM}
        \end{equation}
        so that the classical spectral energy density is
        \begin{equation}
            u_{\mathrm{RJ}}(\omega,T)\,\mathrm{d}\omega
            = \frac{\omega^2}{\pi^2 c^3} k_{\mathrm B}T\,\mathrm{d}\omega.
            \label{eq:u-RJ}
        \end{equation}
        The total energy density $u(T) = \int_0^\infty u_{\mathrm{RJ}}(\omega,T)\,\mathrm{d}\omega$
        diverges as $\omega^3$ at the upper limit, giving the well-known ultraviolet catastrophe
        in the purely classical field picture~\cite{Rayleigh1900,Jeans1905,Planck1901}.

        In the present framework, the electromagnetic field is regarded as a macroscopic,
        irrotational manifestation of the motion of an underlying incompressible fluid with
        circulation-loop microstructure. Maxwell's equations and their cavity eigenmodes are
        left intact at the macroscopic level. What changes is the interpretation of the
        \emph{microstates} underlying a given field configuration: instead of independent
        field oscillators, the microstates are mechanical configurations of circulation loops.
        We now show that the kinematics of these loops restricts the set of physically
        realisable high-frequency modes, effectively regularizing the Rayleigh--Jeans
        integral without any modification of Maxwell's equations.

        \subsection{Maximal rotational frequency from core size and tangential speed}

            As in Sec.~\ref{sec:vortex-gas}, we consider thin circulation loops (vortex rings)
            of core radius $a$ embedded in a homogeneous incompressible fluid of density $\rho_f$.
            Inside the core, the tangential speed $v_\theta(r)$ of the fluid elements is bounded
            by a characteristic value $v_0$, so that
            \begin{equation}
                v_\theta(r) \leq v_0 \quad \text{for } 0 \leq r \leq a.
            \end{equation}
            The associated angular frequency at radius $r$ is
            \begin{equation}
                \Omega(r) = \frac{v_\theta(r)}{r},
            \end{equation}
            so that the maximal angular frequency attainable within the core is bounded by
            \begin{equation}
                \Omega_{\max}
                = \max_{0<r\leq a} \frac{v_\theta(r)}{r}
                \lesssim \frac{v_0}{a}.
                \label{eq:Omega-max}
            \end{equation}
            This bound is purely kinematic: it expresses the fact that no fluid element can
            circulate around the core with tangential speed exceeding $v_0$ at a radius smaller
            than $a$. In particular, it implies a minimal time scale
            \begin{equation}
                \tau_{\min} \sim \frac{1}{\Omega_{\max}} \gtrsim \frac{a}{v_0},
            \end{equation}
            below which the fluid cannot respond to external forcing or internal excitations
            without violating the speed bound.

            In the present context, we will denote by
            \begin{equation}
                \omega_{\max} \equiv \Omega_{\max}
            \end{equation}
            the characteristic maximal angular frequency associated with internal rotational
            motion in the circulation-loop cores.
            This frequency provides a mechanical upper bound on how rapidly the substrate
            can be made to oscillate locally. Any putative field mode with $\omega \gg \omega_{\max}$
            would require fluid motions inside the cores with periods shorter than $\tau_{\min}$
            and hence tangential speeds above $v_0$, which are excluded by construction.

        \subsection{Mechanically realizable field modes}

            Maxwell's equations in vacuum (or in a homogeneous dielectric) admit harmonic
            solutions with arbitrarily large wave number $k$ and frequency
            $\omega = c k$.
            In the purely field-theoretic picture, nothing prevents one from populating modes
            with $k \to \infty$. In the present mechanical picture, however, such field
            configurations must be realizable as coarse-grained manifestations of the motion
            of the underlying fluid.

            We will not attempt to derive Maxwell's equations from the fluid model.
            Instead, we make the following conservative, kinematic assumption:

            \begin{quote}
                \emph{For a given cavity geometry and boundary conditions, we restrict attention
                to those electromagnetic normal modes whose spatial and temporal variations can
                be generated by configurations of circulation loops whose internal rotational
                frequencies do not exceed $\omega_{\max}$.}
            \end{quote}

            Operationally, this means that among the continuum of formal cavity eigenmodes,
            only those with angular frequency $\omega$ up to some effective cutoff
            \begin{equation}
                \omega \lesssim \omega_{\max}
                \label{eq:omega-cut}
            \end{equation}
            can actually be excited in thermal equilibrium with the mechanical substrate.
            Modes with $\omega \gg \omega_{\max}$ exist as mathematical solutions of the field
            equations, but there is no mechanical microstate in the circulation-loop gas that
            corresponds to their excitation at finite amplitude; they are therefore excluded
            from the thermodynamic counting of microstates.

            Equivalently, one may say that the \emph{effective} density of thermally accessible
            modes is modified from Eq.~\eqref{eq:g-EM} to
            \begin{equation}
                g_{\mathrm{eff}}(\omega)
                = g_{\mathrm{EM}}(\omega)\,f\!\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{\max}}\right),
                \label{eq:g-eff}
            \end{equation}
            where $f(x)$ is a dimensionless cutoff function satisfying
            \begin{equation}
                f(x) \to 1 \quad (x\ll 1),
                \qquad
                f(x) \to 0 \quad (x\gg 1),
                \label{eq:f-asymptotics}
            \end{equation}
            and decaying sufficiently rapidly as $x\to\infty$ to render the total energy finite.
            The detailed form of $f$ depends on the microphysics of the circulation-loop gas
            and on how electromagnetic excitations couple to it; for the present discussion,
            only the existence of such an $f$ with the stated asymptotics is required.

        \subsection{Modified Rayleigh--Jeans spectrum and finiteness of energy}

            With the mechanically constrained mode set~\eqref{eq:g-eff}, the classical
            Rayleigh--Jeans spectral energy density becomes
            \begin{equation}
                u_{\mathrm{eff}}(\omega,T)\,\mathrm{d}\omega
                = \frac{\omega^2}{\pi^2 c^3} k_{\mathrm B}T\,
                f\!\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{\max}}\right)\mathrm{d}\omega.
                \label{eq:u-eff}
            \end{equation}
            The total energy density is
            \begin{equation}
                u(T)
                = \int_0^\infty u_{\mathrm{eff}}(\omega,T)\,\mathrm{d}\omega
                = \frac{k_{\mathrm B}T}{\pi^2 c^3}
                \int_0^\infty \omega^2
                f\!\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{\max}}\right)\mathrm{d}\omega.
                \label{eq:u-T-integral}
            \end{equation}
            By changing variables $x = \omega/\omega_{\max}$, this becomes
            \begin{equation}
                u(T)
                = \frac{k_{\mathrm B}T}{\pi^2 c^3}\,\omega_{\max}^3
                \int_0^\infty x^2 f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x.
            \end{equation}
            Under the mild assumption that the integral
            \begin{equation}
                C_f \equiv \int_0^\infty x^2 f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x
            \end{equation}
            converges (which follows from the decay of $f$ as $x\to\infty$), we obtain
            \begin{equation}
                u(T)
                = \frac{k_{\mathrm B}T}{\pi^2 c^3}\,\omega_{\max}^3 C_f,
                \label{eq:u-T-finite}
            \end{equation}
            which is finite for all finite $T$ and scales linearly with temperature in the
            regime where equipartition holds. The ultraviolet divergence of the naive
            Rayleigh--Jeans integral is thus removed by the mechanical restriction of the
            mode set; the formal field-theoretic density of states~\eqref{eq:g-EM} is
            replaced, for thermodynamic purposes, by the effective density~\eqref{eq:g-eff}
            that accounts for the finite response time and finite core size of the substrate.

            As a simple illustration, consider the sharp-cutoff choice
            \begin{equation}
                f(x) =
                \begin{cases}
                    1, & 0 \leq x \leq 1,\\[3pt]
                    0, & x > 1,
                \end{cases}
            \end{equation}
            which encodes the assumption that modes with $\omega \leq \omega_{\max}$ are fully
            accessible, while those with $\omega > \omega_{\max}$ are inaccessible.
            In that case,
            \begin{equation}
                C_f = \int_0^1 x^2\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{1}{3},
            \end{equation}
            and Eq.~\eqref{eq:u-T-finite} reduces to
            \begin{equation}
                u(T)
                = \frac{k_{\mathrm B}T}{3\pi^2 c^3}\,\omega_{\max}^3.
                \label{eq:u-RJ-cut}
            \end{equation}
            This is precisely the Rayleigh--Jeans result with a hard frequency cutoff
            at $\omega_{\max}$, now justified mechanically by the finite core size and maximal
            tangential speed of the circulation loops. For more realistic, smooth cutoff
            functions $f(x)$ the prefactor $C_f$ changes, but the qualitative conclusion
            remains: the energy density is finite and scales as $\omega_{\max}^3$.

        \subsection{Maxwell's equations and the role of the substrate}

            It is important to emphasize what has and has not been modified in this construction.
            At the macroscopic level:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item The form of Maxwell's equations and their normal-mode solutions in a cavity
                are left unchanged. The usual mode density~\eqref{eq:g-EM} remains valid
                as a statement about the spectrum of solutions to the field equations.

                \item The relations $P V = N k_{\mathrm B}T$ and $P = \tfrac{1}{3}u$ for the
                effective quasiparticles (Sec.~\ref{sec:vortex-gas}) are derived from
                standard kinetic theory and from the isotropy of the momentum distribution,
                without any modification of the field equations.
            \end{itemize}

            What \emph{does} change is the set of microstates that are admitted when one asks
            how a given electromagnetic field configuration is realized mechanically.
            In the usual classical treatment, each normal mode is assigned an independent
            harmonic-oscillator degree of freedom and hence contributes $k_{\mathrm B}T$ to
            the energy in the classical limit. In the present fluid-based model, the
            independent microstates are not field amplitudes but configurations of circulation
            loops obeying the kinematic constraints of incompressible Euler flow. These
            constraints imply a finite maximal rotational frequency $\omega_{\max}$ and
            thereby restrict the subset of cavity modes that can be populated in thermal
            equilibrium with the substrate.

            In this sense, the incompressible fluid with circulation-loop microstructure
            acts as a \emph{mechanical regulator} of the ultraviolet behavior of classical
            radiation. The Rayleigh--Jeans divergence does not arise, not because the
            field equations are altered, but because the assumption of an infinite set of
            independent harmonic oscillators is replaced by a finite-density set of
            mechanically realizable excitations whose internal time scales cannot be
            shorter than $1/\omega_{\max}$.

            From the thermodynamic point of view, the key result of this section is that
            the ultraviolet behavior of the classical radiation spectrum is rendered finite
            once the microstate space is defined in terms of circulation loops with finite
            core radius and bounded tangential speed. The subsequent sections will explore
            how this mechanical cutoff scale compares with known microscopic scales in
            high-energy physics and what, if any, observable consequences might arise in
            astrophysical or cosmological contexts.
