  "description": "This manuscript documents a canonical reference implementation of the Swirl--String Theory (SST) invariant mass kernel, as encoded in . The kernel maps a topological object \\(T\\) (specified by braid index \\(b_T\\), Seifert genus \\(g_T\\), component count \\(n_T\\), and a dimensionless total ropelength \\(L_{}(T)\\)) into an inertial mass \\(M(T)\\) via a fixed, mode-independent functional.\n            Three computation paths are supported:  (strict evaluation with fixed quark-geometry factors),  (single baryon-sector normalization fixed by the proton), and  (analytic closure in which the proton and neutron are matched exactly without modifying the kernel).\n            A semi-empirical nuclear binding correction is used to map nucleon-level predictions to atomic masses.\n            In the  mode (electron, proton, neutron exact by construction), the benchmark over elements H--U yields mean absolute percentage error \\({\\) with maximum absolute error \\({\\) for the fixed \\((Z,N)\\) table used. A small molecule set (19 formulas) yields mean absolute percentage error \\({\\).",
