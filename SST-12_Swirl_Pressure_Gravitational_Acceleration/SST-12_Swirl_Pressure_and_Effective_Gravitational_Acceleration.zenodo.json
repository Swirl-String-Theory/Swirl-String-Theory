  "description": "<p>This article explores how pressure gradients in steady axisymmetric swirling flows can be recast as an effective gravitational acceleration within the framework of classical incompressible Euler theory. Starting from the steady Euler equations for an azimuthal velocity field \\( \\boldsymbol{v}(r) = v_\\theta(r)\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\), we derive the radial balance \\( (1/\\rho)\\,\\mathrm{d}p/\\mathrm{d}r = v_\\theta^2(r)/r - g_r(r) \\), linking centripetal acceleration, pressure gradient, and any external radial body force \\( g_r \\). In the absence of external gravity (\\( g_r = 0 \\)), we define an effective acceleration \\( g_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r) = v_\\theta^2(r)/r \\) and an effective potential \\( \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}} = -p/\\rho \\) such that \\( g_{\\mathrm{eff}} = -\\mathrm{d}\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/\\mathrm{d}r \\). For the specific swirl profile \\( v_\\theta(r) = \\sqrt{GM/r} \\), we obtain \\( g_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r) = GM/r^2 \\) and a pressure field \\( p(r) = -\\rho GM/r + p_0 \\), so that \\( \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r) = -GM/r + \\text{const.} \\) matches the radial dependence of the Newtonian point-mass potential. The paper explains the physical limitations of this analogy, including the lack of universality (dependence on fluid and inclusion density), the absence of spacetime curvature, and possible hydrodynamic instabilities of such profiles. The work is positioned with respect to analogue-gravity models in moving media, but remains entirely within mainstream incompressible Euler flow and Newtonian gravity in the weak-field limit.</p>",
