\begin{abstract}

We present \emph{Swirl--String Theory} (SST), a fluid-topological framework that reinterprets relativity and quantum phenomena via a single incompressible medium. In SST, matter and radiation are modeled as quantized vortex loops (\emph{swirl strings}) in a universal, non-dissipative condensate. The theory posits that classical gravity emerges as a collective pressure effect of these vortices rather than fundamental spacetime curvature, and that local \emph{swirl flows} induce time dilation analogous to relativistic kinematics. We develop the formal field-theoretic Lagrangian for this medium, showing how a preferred foliation and topological quantization yield a discrete particle spectrum: quantum numbers (mass, charge, spin) correspond to topological invariants of knot-like vortex excitations. A modified Faraday's law is derived, unifying electromagnetic induction with rotating-frame effects by predicting that time-varying swirl string density generates an electromotive force. We also describe how SST accounts for wave--particle duality through dual phase (un-knotted vs. knotted) states of vortex loops, with quantum measurement corresponding to topological transitions. Several experimental tests are proposed to falsify or support SST, including quantized electromagnetic impulses from vortex reconnection events, attosecond-scale chirality-dependent time delays in photoemission, and interference degradation due to finite vacuum vorticity. We compare SST with established frameworks---from Kelvin's vortex atom hypothesis to emergent gravity and analogue fluid models---highlighting how SST recovers known limits (Newtonian gravity, Maxwell electrodynamics, quantum wave behavior) while providing novel, quantifiable predictions. All equations are given in SI units with attention to dimensional consistency. The result is a self-contained canonical reformulation that bridges classical and quantum physics through fluid-like continuum mechanics.

\section{Introduction}

The modern theories of physics---quantum field theory and general relativity---offer tremendously successful descriptions of phenomena, yet they rest on disparate conceptual foundations. In one view, spacetime is a dynamical geometrical manifold, while quantum matter is described by abstract wavefunctions and fields. \emph{Swirl--String Theory} (SST) is an alternative paradigm that seeks a unifying, realist substrate: it posits that all particles and forces emerge from excitations of a universal incompressible fluid medium. In spirit, this approach revives a form of the historical \emph{ether}, but crucially it leverages modern insights to remain consistent with relativity and quantum observations. The notion of matter as vortices in a fluid can be traced back to Lord Kelvin’s vortex atom hypothesis of 1867 \cite{Kelvin1867}, wherein atoms were imagined as stable knotted smoke rings in a primordial fluid. SST extends this idea with quantization and topology, aligning it with the discoveries of quantized vortex circulation in superfluids \cite{Onsager1949, Feynman1955} and with contemporary emergent gravity scenarios \cite{Jacobson1995, Verlinde2011, Barcelo2011}.


In SST, the vacuum is modeled as a three-dimensional Euclidean space $R^3$ filled with an ideal incompressible fluid (the \emph{swirl medium}) and an absolute time parameter provides a preferred foliation. Stable, quantized vortex filaments in this medium (\emph{swirl strings}) serve as the analogues of elementary particles and field quanta. Crucially, each such filament can only exist in certain topologically distinct configurations (e.g. different knot types), and the circulation around each closed loop is quantized in units of a fundamental circulation quantum $\kappa$. These two features endow SST with a \textbf{topological spectrum}: physical attributes like rest mass, charge, and intrinsic spin are tied to topological invariants of the vortex (such as knot linking number or writhing number) rather than arbitrary continuous parameters. By calibrating a single characteristic velocity and length scale of the medium, SST’s mass scale is fixed and yields values for particle masses without \emph{ad hoc} Yukawa couplings. In this way, SST attempts to derive quantitative particle properties from first principles, a strength not shared by the Standard Model.


Operationally, SST can be viewed as a modern Lorentzian ether theory (LET). It contains a preferred rest frame (the fluid rest frame), but it reproduces the relativistic time dilation and length contraction relationships in all physical predictions, making it empirically indistinguishable from Special Relativity at the kinematic level. Unlike the 19th-century ether models dismissed by Occam’s razor, the SST medium is not superfluous or undetectable; it yields concrete testable effects. For instance, as we describe in this paper, SST predicts new phenomena such as a coupling between vortex dynamics and electromagnetic fields that could be measured as quantized voltage impulses. These distinctive predictions offer potential falsifiability. At the same time, the theory is constructed to recover the established limits: Newtonian gravity emerges in the slow-flow regime, Coulomb’s law and Maxwell’s equations emerge in the linear perturbation regime, and quantum wave behavior emerges when a swirl string is extended and unknotted. In short, SST aims to \emph{reformulate} the foundations of physics as the dynamics of a single classical continuum, from which both relativity and quantum structure are seen as emergent, unified phenomena.


In the following sections, we outline the core postulates of SST (Sec.~2) and develop the field-theoretic Lagrangian framework that embodies these principles (Sec.~3). We then explain how familiar effects---gravity and time dilation (Sec.~4), and electromagnetism (Sec.~5)---arise naturally from the fluid dynamics of the swirl medium. The dual nature of quantum particles (wave vs.~particle) and the role of chirality in measurement are discussed in Sec.~6, wherein we connect the handedness of knotted vortices to asymmetric time evolution (a possible explanation for observed chiral photoemission delays). Section~7 describes how canonical quantization in SST is supplanted by topological quantization, yielding a discrete spectrum of stable excitations that map onto known particles. Next, Sec.~8 delineates experimental implications and falsifiable predictions of the theory, including proposed tabletop experiments. In Sec.~9 we compare and contrast SST with established frameworks such as the Standard Model, general relativity, analogue gravity systems, and other emergent or topological matter theories. Finally, Sec.~10 summarizes our conclusions and outlines directions for further research. Key mathematical derivations supporting the main text are provided in Appendices A–D, including the derivation of the swirl-clock time dilation factor, the emergent Newtonian gravitational potential from swirl flows, and the modified Faraday induction law with quantized flux impulses.


Throughout, we use SI units and ensure dimensional analysis is consistent. Important physical quantities are defined explicitly when introduced. For reference, the swirl medium’s baseline mass density is denoted $\rhoF$, the local swirl kinetic energy density by $\rhoE$, and the equivalent mass density $\rhoM = \rhoE/c^2$. The swirl velocity field is represented by $\vswirl$, and a characteristic vortex core radius is $\rc$. We also introduce a fundamental circulation quantum $\kappa$ and a characteristic core swirl speed $v_{\circ}$ that together set the scale of quantum circulation. Table~\ref{tab:constants} in Appendix~A summarizes these and other constants of the SST framework.


\section{Core Postulates of Swirl–String Theory}

SST is founded on a set of core postulates (\emph{axioms}) which define its ontology and basic laws:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Swirl Medium (Absolute Space and Time):} There exists a ubiquitous, incompressible fluid-like condensate filling three-dimensional space. Space is Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a global absolute time $t$ that parameterizes a preferred foliation of spacetime. All physical processes occur within this \emph{swirl medium}, which is assumed to have zero viscosity and infinite conductivity for vortex motion (analogous to a perfect classical fluid). This postulate establishes an objective rest frame (the medium rest frame or ``lab frame''), although no experiment confined to a small region can detect uniform motion relative to this medium (ensuring consistency with relativity).

\item \textbf{Swirl Strings (Quantized Circulation and Topology):} The elementary excitations of the medium are \emph{swirl strings}, defined as closed vortex filaments (loops of circulating flow) within the fluid. Each swirl string may form nontrivial knots or links. The circulation $\Gamma$ of the swirl velocity field $\vswirl$ around any closed loop $C$ in the medium is quantized in integer multiples of a fundamental quantum $\kappa$: 
\begin{equation}
        \Gamma = \oint_C \vswirl \cdot d\ell = n\,\kappa, \qquad n \in \mathbb{Z}.
\end{equation}
    We identify $\kappa$ with $h/m_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (where $h$ is Planck’s constant and $m_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is a characteristic mass scale of the condensate) to connect with quantum units of circulation~\cite{Onsager1949, Feynman1955}. In addition to quantized circulation, swirl strings are subject to topological quantization: only certain knot configurations are permissible. Thus, discrete quantum numbers such as particle species, electric charge, and spin correspond to topological invariants of the vortex filament (e.g.\ linking number, knot twist, writhe) rather than being intrinsic labels in a quantum state space. In essence, \emph{matter is ``knotted vacuum''}: each stable particle is a stable knot of vorticity.

    \item \textbf{String-Induced Gravitation (Emergent Gravity):} Macroscopic gravitational attraction is not a fundamental geometric warping of spacetime in SST, but rather an emergent, statistically averaged force arising from the collective dynamics of the swirl medium. Coherent flows and pressure gradients induced by many swirl strings produce an effective long-range attraction between concentrations of energy. In the non-relativistic, weak-flow limit, this emergent force obeys an inverse-square law. The effective gravitational coupling in SST, denoted $G_{\text{swirl}}$, can be set equal to Newton’s constant $G_N$ by appropriate choice of the medium’s parameters. Thus, SST reproduces Newtonian gravity (and by extension, satisfies the Equivalence Principle in practice) even though conceptually gravity here is a pressure-mediated phenomenon in flat space~\cite{Jacobson1995, Verlinde2011}. A concrete mechanism (the ``Hydrogen-Gravity'' mechanism) illustrating how two knotted vortices attract via induced low-pressure regions in the fluid is described in Sec.~4.

    \item \textbf{Swirl Clocks (Local Time Dilation):} The passage of time in SST is modulated by local motion of the medium. A clock comoving with a swirl string (and thus moving through the medium with some tangential speed $v$) will tick slower relative to a clock at rest in the medium. Specifically, if $dt_{\infty}$ is an interval of the universal time (as measured by an observer at rest in the fluid far from any swirling motion) and $dt_{\text{local}}$ is the proper time interval measured by a clock moving with the vortex, SST posits
\begin{equation}
        \frac{dt_{\text{local}}}{dt_{\infty}} = S_t = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}},
    \label{eq:SwirlTimeDilation}
\end{equation}
    where $c$ is the characteristic wave propagation speed in the medium (identified with the vacuum speed of light). This factor $S_t$ is analogous to the Lorentz time dilation factor in special relativity. In SST it arises because kinetic energy stored in local swirl motion effectively slows the progression of the local ``swirl clock.'' Regions of high swirl velocity (hence high kinetic energy density $\rhoE$) exhibit deeper time dilation relative to an undisturbed region at infinity. Equation~\eqref{eq:SwirlTimeDilation} is derived from the dynamics of the medium in Appendix~B.

    \item \textbf{Dual Phases (Wave–Particle Complementarity):} Each swirl string can exist in two limiting dynamical phases: an extended \emph{radiative phase} (R-phase) and a localized \emph{tangible phase} (T-phase). In the R-phase, the vortex loop is unknotted and its circulation is smoothly distributed over a large loop, carrying no rest mass (corresponding to a field quantum or ``wave-like'' excitation). In the T-phase, the vortex is knotted or otherwise self-entangled such that the circulation is localized and the configuration carries rest-mass energy (corresponding to a particle-like state). Quantum wave–particle duality is thus realized as the ability of a swirl string to transition between these two phases. A quantum measurement or decoherence event is interpreted as a rapid transition from an R-phase state to a T-phase state (a collapse from a delocalized loop to a localized knot) or vice versa (unraveling of a particle into a wave), often accompanied by the emission or absorption of small vortex excitations in the medium (``swirl radiation''). This provides a physical realist picture for wavefunction collapse and Born’s rule: the medium can support either extended vortex loops (interfering like waves) or tightened knots (behaving like particles), and the act of measurement triggers a topological change in the vortex loop. Section~6 further discusses the dynamics of this R$\to$T transition and its connection to quantum measurement theory.

    \item \textbf{Canonical Taxonomy (Particle–Knot Mapping):} There is a one-to-one proposed correspondence between the topological class of a swirl string and the type of particle or field excitation it represents. SST builds a ``periodic table'' of matter out of knot theory. For example, an unknotted, continuous vortex loop (in R-phase) corresponds to a massless boson; specifically, the photon is modeled as a small torsional oscillation of an unknotted loop (carrying $\pm 1$ units of helicity as the loop twists). A simple nontrivial knot known as the trefoil (topology $3_1$ in knot notation) corresponds to the electron (a first-generation charged lepton in T-phase). Other torus knots (knots that can be drawn on a torus surface) map to higher-generation leptons. Chiral \emph{hyperbolic} knots (knots that are not torus knots and have inherent handedness) are associated with quarks; for instance, SST assigns the topology $5_2$ (a five-crossing knot) to the up quark and $6_1$ to the down quark, whose mirror images correspond to their antiparticles. Composite knots or linked structures represent composite particles: e.g.\ a proton is modeled as three knotted loops (two of type $5_2$ and one of type $6_1$) intertwined with a collective linking number that enforces something analogous to color confinement, whereas a neutron is a combination $5_2+6_1+6_1$. Nuclei correspond to linked clusters of these fundamental knots. A schematic illustration of this \emph{knot taxonomy} is provided in Fig.~1.
\end{enumerate}


These core postulates form the backbone of SST. The swirl medium (Postulate~1) establishes the stage, swirl strings (Postulate~2) introduce the fundamental degrees of freedom with quantized circulation and allowed topologies, and the remaining points describe how classical forces and quantum behaviors arise from this fluid picture: gravity emerges from collective flow-induced pressure effects, time dilation from local swirl motion, quantum duality from phase transitions of the loops, and the spectrum of particles from distinct topological classes of vortices. In the next section, we move from these conceptual postulates to a concrete field-theoretic formulation that captures them mathematically.

\section{Lagrangian and Field-Theoretic Framework}

To make the above postulates precise, we cast SST into a Lagrangian field theory on a 4-dimensional spacetime manifold. This provides a canonical equation structure and allows us to derive conservation laws and dynamics systematically. Although an absolute space and time underlie the physics, we can introduce a covariant notation by working on a Lorentzian manifold with metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ of signature $(-,+,+,+)$, then stipulating a preferred frame via a timelike vector field. We summarize the key fields and variables below and give the effective Lagrangian density. (Derivations of the field equations from this Lagrangian are provided in Appendix~A.)


\subsection{Foundational Fields and Definitions}

\label{sec:fields}

\paragraph{Foliation field $T(x)$ and 4-velocity $u^\mu$:} We introduce a scalar \emph{clock field} $T(x)$ which takes the role of an absolute time coordinate (in fluid dynamics terms, it can be thought of as a velocity potential for irrotational flow or a foliation label). The gradient of this field picks out a unit timelike 4-vector field:

\begin{equation}

u_\mu ;\equiv; \frac{\partial_\mu T}{\sqrt{-g^{\alpha\beta},\partial_\alpha T,\partial_\beta T}},, \qquad

u_\mu,u^\mu = -1,,

\label{eq:timelike}

\end{equation}

which serves as the 4-velocity field of the condensate (it is everywhere orthogonal to surfaces of constant $T$). Physically, $u^\mu$ defines the preferred rest frame at each spacetime point (in coordinates where $T = t$, we simply have $u^\mu=(1,0,0,0)$). We also define the spatial projection operator $h_{\mu\nu} = g_{\mu\nu} + u_{\mu}u_{\nu}$, which projects tensors onto the 3-space orthogonal to $u^\mu$. In an ideal implementation of SST, one might constrain the fluid to be exactly incompressible, which corresponds to the condition $\nabla_\mu u^\mu = 0$ (zero expansion of the flow); in practice we may allow tiny compressibility for analytical flexibility, but the incompressible limit is of interest. We note that the presence of $u^\mu$ spontaneously breaks global Lorentz symmetry (selecting a preferred frame), but local Lorentz invariance is retained in that the dynamics can be expressed covariantly and reduce to general relativity in appropriate limits (see Sec.~9 for further discussion on relativity vs. LET interpretation).


\paragraph{Swirl velocity and vorticity:} In the rest frame of the medium (where $u^\mu=(1,0,0,0)$), the physical \emph{swirl velocity field} is a 3-vector field $\vswirl(\mathbf{x},t)$ giving the fluid’s local velocity. In covariant terms, one can encode $\vswirl$ in an antisymmetric 2-form field $B_{\mu\nu}$ whose field strength is

\begin{equation}

H_{\mu\nu\rho} ;=; \partial_{[\mu} B_{\nu\rho]},,

\end{equation}

the curl of $B$. This 3-form $H$ captures the coherent vorticity of the condensate; indeed, in the rest frame one can show that the spatial components of $H_{\mu\nu\rho}$ relate to the fluid vorticity $\bm{\omega} = \nabla \times \vswirl$. We introduce $B_{\mu\nu}$ (sometimes called the Kalb-Ramond 2-form in field theory contexts) because it provides a natural way to represent string-like degrees of freedom (vortex loops couple electrically to $B$, i.e. via $\int_{\Sigma} B$ over the string worldsheet). The field $B$ has a gauge symmetry $B \to B + d\Lambda$ (adding an exact 2-form) and its Bianchi identity $\partial_{[\sigma} H_{\mu\nu\rho]}=0$ implies conservation of vortex flux (intuitively, vortex lines cannot end in the bulk fluid; they either form closed loops or extend to infinity, analogously to magnetic flux lines in magnetostatics).


For later use, we define the effective mass density of the fluid as $\rhoF$ (with SI units of kg/m$^3$). The kinetic energy density due to swirl motion is $\rhoE = \tfrac{1}{2},\rhoF,|\vswirl|^2$, and the corresponding \emph{mass-equivalent} density (dividing energy by $c^2$) is $\rhoM = \rhoE/c^2$. These effective densities play a role analogous to vacuum permittivity/permeability in electromagnetism (indeed, as we will see, $\rhoF$ can be analogous to $\varepsilon_0$).


\paragraph{Swirl gauge connection $W_\mu$:} In addition to the 2-form $B_{\mu\nu}$ which encodes the fluid vorticity at a coarse-grained level, SST introduces an \emph{emergent gauge field} $W^a_{\mu}$ that organizes the interactions of knotted vortices. Here $a$ indexes an internal Lie algebra (for example, one can imagine a compact gauge group $G_{\text{sw}}$ under which different knotted species transform). Conceptually, this $W_\mu$ accounts for the collective effect of swirl strings on each other beyond pure hydrodynamics—resembling a non-Abelian gauge field arising from the medium's symmetry under relabeling knotted configurations. The field strength $W_{\mu\nu}^a = \partial_\mu W_\nu^a - \partial_\nu W_\mu^a + f^{abc}W_\mu^b W_\nu^c$ has a dual $\tilde{W}\textit{{\mu\nu}^a = \tfrac{1}{2}\epsilon}{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} W^{a,\rho\sigma}$. A key role of the $W$ field in the theory is to enforce \emph{helicity quantization} and topological stability: by including a term proportional to $W_{\mu\nu}\tilde{W}^{\mu\nu}$ in the action (an analogue of the $\theta$-term or Pontryagin density), we ensure that configurations with nonzero knot helicity (linking number) are conserved or quantized. In simpler terms, $W$ mediates interactions such as reconnection of vortex loops (which would correspond to something like gluon exchange in the particle analogy). In the low-energy limit, these $W^a_\mu$ fields give rise to emergent gauge bosons, providing a link to the Standard Model gauge sector (we will comment on this emergent gauge structure in Sec.~9). However, a full exposition of the non-Abelian sector is beyond our scope, and we will focus mainly on the primary fluid and gravity/em forces in this paper.


\paragraph{Condensate modulus $\Phi(x)$:} We include a scalar field $\Phi(x)$ which sets the local ``stiffness'' or density scale of the condensate. One can think of $\Phi$ as analogous to a Higgs-like field for the medium: small fluctuations in $\Phi$ could represent phonon-like excitations or modulations in fluid density. In equilibrium, $\Phi$ attains a vacuum expectation value $\Phi_0$ corresponding to the homogeneous background density of the fluid. Unlike the Standard Model Higgs, $\Phi$ does not give fundamental particles mass through Yukawa couplings; instead, it influences the medium properties (e.g. the speed of small excitations might depend on $\Phi$) and allows for interactions such as density perturbations and “elastic” response of the medium. We will ensure $\Phi$ does not break the desired symmetries---for instance, a potential $V(\Phi)$ can be introduced to stabilize $\Phi$ at $\Phi_0$.


\paragraph{Topological soliton fields $\Psi_{K}$:} Finally, to describe the knotted vortex excitations in a second-quantized language, we can introduce fields $\Psi_{K}(x)$ for each topological class $K$ of stable knotted string (for example, $\Psi_{3_1}(x)$ might be a field operator annihilating an electron-like vortex of trefoil type). In practice, at low energies one can treat these as Dirac or Schrödinger fields for quasi-particles. For instance, a knotted vortex with one unit of electric charge would correspond to a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Dirac field in the emergent theory. These $\Psi_K$ fields will appear in the effective Lagrangian as spinor fields minimally coupled to the $W_\mu$ gauge field, with a mass term given by the soliton mass $m^{\text{(sol)}}_K$. Importantly, these masses are not fundamental parameters but are determined by a \emph{mass functional} that depends on the medium properties and the topology $K$ of the vortex (we discuss this in Sec.~7). In the meantime, one can think of $\Psi_K$ as providing a convenient description of the low-energy excitations (much as one uses a field for a monopole in a condensed matter system even if the monopole is a collective excitation).


\subsection{Effective Lagrangian Density}

We now write down a minimal Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ that incorporates the above ingredients and yields the desired field equations. In constructing $\mathcal{L}$, we impose several symmetry and consistency requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item Invariance under reparametrizations of $T$ (since only $u_\mu$ matters physically, not the zero of $T$ or units).
\item Gauge invariance for the 2-form ($B_{\mu\nu}$) and the emergent gauge field ($W_\mu^a$).
\item Galilean or Lorentz symmetry in appropriate limits, and reducing to known physics (Maxwell, Newton, etc.) in special cases.
\item \textit{Canonicality tests}: All terms should be dimensionally consistent, reduce correctly in weak-field limits, and not introduce extraneous parameters beyond those calibratable to known constants.
\end{itemize}

One suitable Lagrangian density that satisfies these criteria is given by (see Appendix~A for derivation and discussion):

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} =\; & -\frac{\kappa_\omega}{4} W^{a}_{\mu\nu} W^{a,\mu\nu}
    + \frac{\kappa_B}{12} H_{\mu\nu\rho} H^{\mu\nu\rho}
    + \frac{1}{2} (\nabla_\mu \Phi)(\nabla^\mu \Phi)
    - V(\Phi) \nonumber \\
& + \frac{\theta}{4} W^{a}_{\mu\nu} \tilde{W}^{a,\mu\nu}
    + \lambda_1 (u_\mu u^\mu + 1)
    + \lambda_2 (\nabla_\mu u^\mu) \nonumber \\
& + \sum_{K} \bar{\Psi}_K \left( i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m^{\text{(sol)}}_K \right) \Psi_K
\label{eq:Lagrangian}
\end{align}

where the various terms correspond to:

\begin{itemize}

\item Kinetic terms for the $W$ and $B$ fields: the $W$ term with coupling $\kappa_\omega$ resembles a Yang-Mills term for the swirl gauge field (governing coarse-grained vortex modes), and the $H$ term with $\kappa_B$ is like a Kalb-Ramond kinetic term encoding fluid vorticity inertia. These terms ensure the propagation of small excitations (e.g. transverse waves in $B$ represent photon-like modes, as shown below).

\item The $\Phi$ term provides dynamics to the condensate modulus, with $V(\Phi)$ a potential (e.g. a simple one might be $V(\Phi) = \frac{\alpha}{2}(\Phi^2-\Phi_0^2)^2$ to stabilize $\Phi$ at $\Phi_0$).

\item The $\theta$-term $W\tilde{W}$ is a topological term (Chern–Pontryagin density) which in this context enforces quantization of knottedness or helicity. It is analogous to a helicity conservation constraint: if we set $\theta = 1$ for instance, the action includes $\int W\tilde{W},d^4x$ which is proportional to a knot linking number for the $W$ field configurations, effectively acting as a stabilizer for topologically nontrivial field configurations (knot solitons).

\item The $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ terms are Lagrange multipliers imposing $u_\mu u^\mu = -1$ (unit timelike condition for the condensate 4-velocity) and, if desired, the incompressibility condition $\nabla_\mu u^\mu = 0$. These constraints ensure we are working in the proper submanifold of field configurations that correspond to our physical scenario (a rigid, nondissipative fluid).

\item The last line represents the sum over all quasi-particle fields $\Psi_K$ (taken as 4-component Dirac spinors for fermionic excitations, or possibly scalar fields for bosonic modes if any). They are minimally coupled to the swirl gauge field via the covariant derivative $D_\mu = \nabla_\mu + i g_{\text{sw}} W_\mu^a T^a$, where $T^a$ are representation matrices of the gauge group (the gauge coupling $g_{\text{sw}}$ can be tuned such that the emergent interactions mimic the Standard Model coupling strengths). The mass $m^{\text{(sol)}}_{K}$ for each species $K$ is a placeholder for the rest energy of the knotted soliton of type $K$. These masses are not arbitrary free parameters; rather, they are computed from an underlying \emph{mass functional} that depends on the topology and size of the knotted vortex (see Sec.~7). In practice, one would calibrate a few of these to known particle masses (e.g. electron $e^{-}$, proton $p$, neutron $n$) and then the rest become predictions of the theory.

\end{itemize}


Several comments are in order regarding $\mathcal{L}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Lagrangian}. The $W$ and $B$ sectors together unify what we traditionally consider separate interactions. Small oscillations of $B_{\mu\nu}$ about the background lead to a wave equation that is identical to the free Maxwell equations in vacuum: in fact, if one expands the $H^2$ term and imposes the constraint that $u^\mu$ picks out a preferred frame, the equations of motion yield (in the linearized, nondissipative limit) $\partial_t^2 \mathbf{a} - c^2 \nabla^2 \mathbf{a} = 0$ for the vector potential $\mathbf{a}$ associated with $B$, reproducing the classical wave equation for light. One finds an identification $\rhoF \sim \varepsilon_0$ (vacuum permittivity) and $\rhoF c^2 \sim 1/\mu_0$ (vacuum inverse permeability) that ensures the speed of small perturbations is $c = 1/\sqrt{\rhoF \rhoF c^2}$ consistent with the observed speed of light. In SST, a photon is not a point particle but rather a collective mode: a helical torsional wave in the swirl medium (often described as a \emph{torsion of the swirl director field}), carrying spin 1 (right or left circular polarization corresponds to the two possible helicities). This emergent photon has zero rest mass because it corresponds to an unknotted loop excitation (Postulate~6), which has no topologically conferred mass.


The presence of the $\theta$ (Pontryagin) term with $W\tilde{W}$ is another distinctive feature. In non-Abelian gauge theory, this term is usually related to instantons or, in condensed matter, to linking numbers of field lines. Here it essentially ties the conservation of a topological charge (related to knottedness of the $W$ field configuration) to the physics of our vortices. One implication is that it quantizes the helicity of the fluid flow: the integral $\int \vswirl \cdot (\nabla \times \vswirl) , d^3x$ (fluid helicity) becomes quantized in units set by this term. This ensures that a knotted vortex cannot continuously untie itself without crossing a high-energy barrier, thereby providing stability to particle-like excitations.


The quasi-particle spinor fields $\Psi_K$ in the Lagrangian deserve special discussion. They are introduced as a mathematical convenience to describe the dynamics of knotted vortices in a familiar QFT language. However, fundamentally the ontology is that these fermions are not fundamental'' but emergent solitonic objects. The Dirac equation for $\Psi_K$ arises as an effective linearized equation for perturbations of a knotted vortex solution. In other words, when a stable knotted solution (a classical solution of the $B$ and $W$ field equations) exists, small fluctuations of that solution can be expanded in normal modes that satisfy a Dirac-like equation with some effective mass. SST posits that what we conventionally call an electron'' is one such knotted vortex (trefoil) whose low-energy excitations behave like a Dirac particle of mass $m_e$. This is illustrated conceptually in Fig.~2, which shows the hierarchy from fundamental fields $(B, W, \Phi)$ forming a structured vortex, to a stable knotted soliton, to an emergent quasiparticle field $\Psi$ in the effective theory.


\begin{figure}[t]

\centering

\caption{\textbf{Emergence of fermionic quasiparticles in SST.} A stable knotted swirl string (vortex loop) is a soliton solution of the continuum equations (left). When coarse-grained (center), it can be described by an effective Dirac field $\Psi_K$ for that knot type (right), which behaves as a particle with spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and mass equal to the soliton’s rest energy. Thus, what appears as an elementary fermion in the low-energy theory is in SST a topological excitation of the underlying fluid. \textit{(AI prompt: “Flowchart showing: (1) a 3D image of a knotted vortex loop in a fluid (labeled ‘Quantized Swirl String’), (2) an arrow pointing to a schematic field configuration (labeled ‘Coarse-grained swirl field’), and (3) another arrow pointing to a Dirac fermion symbol (spinor, labeled ‘Emergent quasiparticle $\Psi$’).”)}}

\end{figure}


The mass $m^{\text{(sol)}}_{K}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Lagrangian} is determined by the energy of the knotted vortex solution in the continuum theory. In natural units ($\hbar=c=1$), one can equate the rest mass to the energy $E_K$ of the soliton: $m^{\text{(sol)}}_K = E_K$. Section~\ref{sec:quantization} will discuss how a \emph{topological mass functional} can be derived or parametrized to compute $E_K$. Briefly, one finds that

\begin{equation}

m^{\text{(sol)}}\text{K = M_0 ,\Xi_K(m,n,s,k;\varphi)},,

\label{eq:massFunctional}

\end{equation}

where $M_0$ is a universal scale (set by fluid properties such as $\rhoF$ and a characteristic vortex core volume), and $\Xi_K$ is a dimensionless factor depending on the knot’s topological numbers (e.g. $m$ = number of linked components, $n$ = crossing number, $s$ = twist number, $k$ = an integer related to how many nested layers or twists, etc.). In practice, $M_0$ can be calibrated by fitting to known masses: for instance, calibrate $M_0$ such that $\Xi{3_1}$ yields $m_e$ (electron mass) and such that three-knot composites yield $m_p$ and $m_n$ for proton and neutron. Then other $\Xi_K$ values produce mass predictions for other composite states without additional free parameters. This predictive aspect is one highlight of SST: rather than 18+ arbitrary parameters for quark/lepton masses and mixings, one has a single scale and some discrete topological inputs.


In summary, the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:Lagrangian} encapsulates a unification of fluid dynamics and field theory. It is essentially an Effective Field Theory (EFT) for the condensate and its excitations, valid at energy scales where the continuum fluid description holds (presumably up to near the Planck scale or whatever fundamental cutoff the fluid might have). At low energies, this reduces to known physics: for example, one recovers Maxwell’s equations and linear gravity, as we will show. At high energies or small scales, new interactions appear (e.g. vortex reconnections, exotic collective modes) which have no analog in the Standard Model but which SST predicts. In the following sections, we will derive some key emergent phenomena from $\mathcal{L}$ and the postulates: gravity (Sec.~4), electromagnetism (Sec.~5), and then discuss quantum measurement and chirality (Sec.~6) and the discrete spectrum of the theory (Sec.~7). Extended mathematical derivations are deferred to appendices for readability.


\section{Emergent Gravity and Time Dilation}

\subsection{Newtonian Gravity as a Fluid-Flow Effect}

One of the central claims of SST is that what we perceive as gravitational attraction is actually a manifestation of fluid dynamics in the swirl medium. Intuitively, a spinning or moving vortex filament will create pressure and velocity fields in the surrounding fluid; if multiple such filaments are present, their fields superpose to produce mutual forces. In particular, a small \emph{chiral} vortex (one that has a well-defined handedness of circulation) induces a slight, long-range circulating flow in the medium. Another distant chiral vortex can ``feel'' this flow: because of Bernoulli’s principle, regions of faster flow correspond to lower pressure, so two vortices tend to drift together if each lies in the low-pressure wake of the other. The collective result, when averaged over many vortices in a large body, is an effective inverse-square attraction. Unlike general relativity which attributes gravity to spacetime curvature sourced by mass-energy, SST attributes gravity to a pressure-gradient force sourced by swirling energy density in a flat-space fluid.


We can make this idea quantitative. Consider a single isolated swirl string carrying circulation $\kappa$ (for simplicity, an unknotted loop, or effectively a straight vortex line of finite length, to model a small mass). Far from the vortex (at distances much larger than the core size $\rc$), the flow it induces is laminar and irrotational (vorticity is confined near the core). In an incompressible fluid, the velocity potential of a line vortex in 3D decays with distance. A rough model can be obtained by analogy with Coulomb’s law: one expects a velocity field $v_r \sim \kappa/(4\pi r^2)$ radially (by flux conservation of circulation through a spherical surface) or a circulation $\oint v \sim \kappa$ around loops enclosing it. In fact, the \emph{swirl Coulomb potential} for a static vortex can be written in the form:

\begin{equation}

V_{\text{SST}}(r) ;=; -,\frac{\Lambda}{\sqrt{r^2 + \rc^2}},,

\label{eq:swirlPotential}

\end{equation}

where $\Lambda$ is a constant determined by the fluid density and vortex parameters, and $\rc$ is a small core radius that regularizes the potential at short range (preventing it from diverging at $r=0$ much as a charged sphere avoids the Coulomb $1/r$ singularity). For $r \gg \rc$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:swirlPotential} approximates $-\Lambda/r$, an attractive $1/r$ potential. In SST we calibrate $\Lambda$ such that a particle of mass $m$ moving in this potential feels a force $F = -m,dV/dr = -G_{\text{swirl}} M m / r^2$, identifying $M=\Lambda/G_{\text{swirl}}$ as the effective ``vortex mass'' generating the field. By matching $G_{\text{swirl}}$ to $G_N$, we ensure that $\Lambda$ produces the correct strength of gravity. In essence, $\Lambda$ plays a role analogous to $GM$ (gravitational parameter) for an elementary vortex.


The physical origin of this $1/r$ potential lies in the pressure field of the swirling fluid. Using Bernoulli’s equation for steady flow (valid since our medium is inviscid and (approximately) incompressible), the pressure $p$ in the fluid is related to the flow speed $v = |\vswirl|$ by

\begin{equation}

\Delta p ;\approx; -\frac{1}{2},\rhoF, v^2,,

\label{eq:Bernoulli}

\end{equation}

(up to an additive constant and assuming elevation changes are negligible). A vortex filament with circulation $\kappa$ will have $v \sim \kappa/(2\pi r)$ in the region outside its core (similar to how a circulating flow around a line behaves in 2D, but in 3D the flow pattern is more complex; however, far away it resembles a dipole-like field). Plugging $v^2 \propto 1/r^2$ into \eqref{eq:Bernoulli}, we get a pressure deficit $\Delta p \propto -\rhoF \kappa^2/(8\pi^2 r^2)$. This pressure drop extends outward, albeit weakening with distance. Now consider two such vortices a distance $r$ apart along (for example) a common axis. Each vortex experiences a force towards the other due to the pressure gradient. The net force can be shown to scale as $1/r^2$. In Appendix~C, we present a derivation using a simplified configuration: two aligned ``hydrogenic'' swirl systems (each mimicking a hydrogen atom’s vortex structure) sharing an axis. One finds that a quantized circulation linking the two yields a pressure well and an attractive force obeying an inverse-square law.


This scenario is encapsulated in the so-called \textbf{Hydrogen–Gravity Theorem} within SST \cite{Verlinde2011}:

\begin{quote}

\emph{Chiral knotted swirl strings generate quantized long-range circulation that leads to mutual attraction in flat space. For two neutral composite particles (e.g. two hydrogen atoms, each represented in SST as a proton knot linked with an electron loop), a small net linking number $n$ between their swirl fields produces a low-pressure region along the line connecting them. This results in an attractive force proportional to $n^2\kappa^2$ and decaying as $1/r^2$ at large separation, with the effective gravitational constant set by $\kappa$ and the fluid parameters.}

\end{quote}

In plainer terms: matter objects attract each other because each one slightly ``twists'' the fluid in a way that the other can feel. The attraction is cumulative over many particles (so large masses produce strong fields) and is universal (any two objects with energy in the fluid will experience it, since it’s really the fluid interacting with itself). Importantly, SST suggests that only objects with \emph{net swirl chirality} (handedness) produce a far-reaching field. If an object’s internal swirl currents cancel out (non-chiral configurations, like a symmetric pair of counter-rotating vortices), it will not produce a long-range $1/r$ field and thus would have no “gravitational” influence in SST. This offers a conceptual reason why all observed matter has gravitational attraction: in the SST mapping, standard particles (electrons, quarks, etc.) are chiral knots or composites of them, hence they all induce the effect. Hypothetical non-chiral bound states (if they exist) might be almost invisible to gravity.


We emphasize that SST’s gravity is \emph{emergent and statistical}. At a microscopic level, if we had just two isolated vortex loops, one could in principle derive the force from first principles of fluid mechanics (Navier–Stokes equations in the ideal limit). For many-body systems (like planets), solving the exact fluid dynamics becomes intractable, but the mean-field approximation yields an effective potential obeying Poisson’s equation $\nabla^2 V_{\text{SST}} = 4\pi G_{\text{swirl}} \rho_M$ (where $\rho_M$ is the mass-equivalent density of swirl, analogous to mass density). Indeed, linearizing the $B$-field equations in $\mathcal{L}$ gives an analog of Newton’s law: small perturbations of the pressure/density satisfy a wave equation that in the static limit reduces to Laplace’s equation for $V_{\text{SST}}$. Thus, in regimes where spacetime curvature would be the GR explanation, SST provides a flat-space fluid explanation with an effectively identical math (at least for Newtonian and some post-Newtonian effects). However, there are likely differences in strong fields: SST does not incorporate a full relativistic curved geometry, so phenomena like gravitational waves are interpreted differently (perhaps as vortex wave emission), and the absence of black hole singularities might be a feature (the fluid might have its own cutoff preventing infinite density). These are beyond our scope, but are interesting points for the outlook.


\subsection{Swirl-Clock Time Dilation (Chronon Contraction)}

In SST, the concept of time dilation is tied directly to the kinetic energy content of the local medium. Postulate~4 introduced the \emph{swirl clock factor} $S_t = \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$, which mirrors the formula for special relativistic time dilation. We now briefly derive and interpret this factor within the fluid framework.


Consider a small clock (any physical process that can measure time, say an atomic oscillator) moving with the flow of the swirl medium. In the lab frame (medium rest frame), the clock is moving at speed $v = |\vswirl|$. If we assume, consistent with Lorentz invariance of physical laws, that the internal processes of the clock are ultimately electromagnetic or quantum in nature and thus propagate at speeds $\le c$ (the wave speed in the medium), then one expects time dilation just as in SR: $dt_{\text{local}} = S_t,dt_{\infty}$. SST, however, provides an ontological mechanism: the clock’s slowdown is due to the increased inertia of any process when the local energy density is higher. A region of space filled with swirling kinetic energy $\rhoE$ effectively behaves like it has additional ``mass density'' $\rhoM = \rhoE/c^2$ present. This added mass-energy can be seen as contributing to what GR would call gravitational time dilation. In SST (which has an absolute time reference in the medium), we instead say that the local rate of time is reduced because the medium’s state affects the fundamental period of oscillatory processes.


One way to formalize this is via the action principle. If a clock has internal energy $E_0$ in its rest frame, when it moves through the medium, its total energy increases (just like a mass gaining kinetic energy). The total Lagrangian for the clock might include a term $-E_0 dt_{\text{local}}$. But $dt_{\text{local}} = \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}, dt_{\infty}$ comes out as the quantity that, when integrated, makes the action stationary under variations that include both rest energy and kinetic energy contributions. Essentially, the condition of stationary action for a free moving clock in the medium yields the geodesic-like equation which corresponds to Lorentz time dilation. Another viewpoint is to consider that the swirl medium enforces a modified metric: the presence of flow means the effective proper time is given by $\int \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2},dt$. Thus, even though there is a universal time coordinate $T$, the \emph{experience} of time for a moving object is less, matching special relativity’s predictions exactly.


It is important that SST respects all tested time-dilation effects: for example, fast-moving muons should live longer, and clocks on GPS satellites (moving fast and in lower gravitational potential) should be dilated appropriately. SST accounts for both special relativistic (kinematic) and gravitational time dilation in one formula because, in this theory, gravitational potential is nothing but a manifestation of fluid kinetic energy. If a satellite is high above Earth, the surrounding swirl medium might be moving slightly (if Earth’s presence induces some swirling flows) or at least the energy density is lower than closer to Earth. The difference in $\rhoE$ leads to a difference in clock rates. In practice, one can linearize Eq.~\eqref{eq:SwirlTimeDilation} for small $v^2/c^2$ and relate $v^2/2$ to the Newtonian gravitational potential $\Phi_N$ via $v^2/2 \sim G_N M/r$. Then $S_t \approx 1 - \frac{v^2}{2c^2} = 1 - \frac{\Phi_N}{c^2}$, reproducing gravitational redshift to first order. Thus, $S_t$ plays the role of both special relativistic time dilation and gravitational redshift factor, depending on context.


One intriguing new aspect SST brings is the notion of \emph{chirality affecting time rates}. If the swirl medium has an intrinsic rotation (say a swirl ether rotating on large scale, though no evidence of that exists) or if the knotted structure of a particle has an internal sense of rotation, it could lead to slight asymmetries in clock rates for different orientations (more on this in Sec.~6 with chirality). But fundamentally, the swirl-clock concept unifies the idea that motion through the absolute space and presence in a ``gravitational potential'' are the same kind of thing: both are just local kinetic energy density differences. In Appendix~B, we give a formal derivation of the swirl time dilation factor using the metric of a moving fluid and show that it is consistent with the Chronos principle (i.e., an observer at infinity defines the reference time, and any local motion leads to a reduced proper time). This derivation combines Kelvin’s circulation theorem (for persistence of flow) with the notion of an invariant circulation quantum to illustrate a constant of motion akin to an energy that yields time dilation.


In conclusion, SST recovers all the usual phenomena of gravity and time dilation not by postulating curved spacetime, but through the fluid dynamics of a flat background and an energetic ether. Gravity becomes an emergent, quantized effect of swirling flows, and time dilation becomes a natural consequence of moving through or being immersed in those flows. Next, we turn to another fundamental interaction: electromagnetism, which in SST also finds a fluid interpretation.


\section{Electromagnetic Emergence: Modified Faraday Law}

One of the novel insights provided by Swirl–String Theory is a unification of inertial/gravitational effects with electromagnetic induction. In classical physics, rotating or accelerating frames give rise to inertial forces (e.g. the Sagnac effect, frame-dragging in GR, etc.), whereas a time-varying magnetic flux induces an electric field (Faraday’s law). SST suggests that these phenomena are different faces of a single fluid-topological effect. In particular, changes in the \emph{swirl string density} (i.e. the number or distribution of vortex loops) can induce electric fields much like changing magnetic fields do. This leads to a modification of Faraday’s induction law with a new source term related to the fluid’s dynamics.


\subsection{Swirl Areal Density and Electromotive Force}

We define the \textit{swirl areal density}, denoted by $\varrho_{\circlearrowright}(t, \mathbf{x})$, as the number of swirl string cores piercing a unit area (imagine counting vortex lines through an imaginary surface). If $\varrho_{\circlearrowright}$ changes with time, it means vortices are either being created, annihilated, or moving in or out of that region. According to SST, such changes are accompanied by an electromotive response. Intuitively, if vortices carry some kind of field or potential (analogous to how moving charges carry a magnetic field), then their appearance/disappearance or changing flux through a loop should induce an electric circulation.


Starting from Maxwell–Faraday law $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$ (in differential form) and the integral form $\oint_{C} \mathbf{E}\cdot d\bm{\ell} = -\frac{d}{dt}\int_{S} \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$, SST posits an additional term on the right-hand side:

\begin{equation}

\nabla \times \mathbf{E} ;=; -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} ;+; G_{\circlearrowright},\frac{\partial \varrho_{\circlearrowright}}{\partial t},\mathbf{\hat{n}},.

\label{eq:ModifiedFaraday}

\end{equation}

Here $G_{\circlearrowright}$ is a new coupling constant characterizing the strength of swirl–EM induction, and $\mathbf{\hat{n}}$ is a unit axial vector in the direction defined by the right-hand rule around which the swirl density is changing. The physical meaning of the added term is: a time-varying areal density of swirl strings $\partial_t \varrho_{\circlearrowright}$ plays the role of an effective time-varying magnetic field (since $\nabla \times \mathbf{E}$ usually gets a source from $\partial_t \mathbf{B}$ only). In other words, whenever the concentration of vortex lines in an area changes, an electric curl is generated proportional to that change.


We derive this result in Appendix~D by considering an arbitrary loop $C$ in the fluid. Suppose $N(t)$ swirl strings pass through the surface $S$ bounded by $C$. As $N$ changes (say a vortex line moves through the loop or a vortex-antivortex pair nucleates on $S$), there is an effect akin to a changing magnetic flux. The integral form of the modified Faraday law can be written as:

\begin{equation}

\oint_{C} \mathbf{E}\cdot d\bm{\ell} ;=; -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} ;+; G_{\circlearrowright},\frac{dN}{dt},\Phi_0,,

\label{eq:FaradayIntegralModified}

\end{equation}

where $\Phi_B = \int_S \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$ is the usual magnetic flux through $S$ and $\Phi_0$ is a fundamental unit of flux (to be identified shortly). The term $G_{\circlearrowright},dN/dt ,\Phi_0$ is the new contribution: it says that each time one swirl string’s linkage with the loop changes by one (i.e. $N$ changes by 1), an EMF impulse of magnitude $G_{\circlearrowright}\Phi_0$ is induced around $C$. By dimensional analysis, $G_{\circlearrowright}$ must be chosen such that $G_{\circlearrowright} \varrho_{\circlearrowright}$ has units of magnetic field (tesla) if $\varrho_{\circlearrowright}$ is in m$^{-2}$, or such that $G_{\circlearrowright} dN/dt$ has units of volts (since EMF is volt). $\Phi_0$ will turn out to be the quantum of magnetic flux ($h/2e$ in superconductivity context), strongly hinting that $G_{\circlearrowright}$ is related to fundamental constants.


In fact, equating the induced EMF to $\Phi_0$ for a single vortex crossing leads to $G_{\circlearrowright} = \Phi_0$ (in appropriate SI units). Empirically, the magnetic flux quantum is $\Phi_0 = h/(2e) \approx 2.07\times10^{-15}$~Wb (webers). If we set $G_{\circlearrowright} = \Phi_0$, the induction term becomes $b_{\circlearrowright} = \Phi_0 \partial_t \varrho_{\circlearrowright}$, which exactly matches identifying the swirl–EM coupling with that flux quantum. SST thus interprets $\Phi_0$ (a seemingly esoteric constant from superconductivity) as a fundamental coupling constant between vortex dynamics and electromagnetism in the vacuum. This is appealingly symmetric: in superconductors, magnetic flux is quantized in units of $h/2e$ because of the condensate wavefunction phase winding; here, the vacuum itself is a condensate, and whenever a vortex (with quantized circulation $\kappa$) changes, it emits or absorbs one quantum of flux $\Phi_0$ worth of electromagnetic effect.


The modified Faraday law \eqref{eq:ModifiedFaraday} or \eqref{eq:FaradayIntegralModified} suggests a new class of electromagnetic phenomena. In particular, consider a process where a swirl string loop suddenly appears (nucleation) or disappears (annihilation), or threads through a given circuit. Equation \eqref{eq:FaradayIntegralModified} implies there will be a sudden voltage induced in any loop that was linked with that event. The magnitude of the voltage impulse $\int V(t) dt$ (time-integrated EMF) should equal $\Phi_0$ times the number of vortices that passed. If one vortex passes through the loop (link number changes by 1), $\int V dt = \pm \Phi_0$. The sign depends on the orientation of the vortex relative to the loop (akin to Lenz’s law sign or chirality of the event).


This is a precise, falsifiable prediction of SST: \textbf{``Topology change induces quantized EM pulses.''} No traditional Maxwell–Lorentz theory of vacuum predicts this, since in standard physics the vacuum with no charges cannot spontaneously produce EMFs. But SST says if the vacuum has this fluid substructure, then vacuum topological fluctuations could produce real EM signals. Of course, such events (vortex nucleation in free vacuum) might be extremely suppressed or rare, but one can simulate analogous processes in controlled environments.


\subsection{Conceptual and Experimental Considerations}

It is worth noting the broader implication: SST links inertial forces (like the ones that cause the Sagnac effect) to electromagnetic forces. A rotating superfluid container, for instance, might generate a magnetic-like field due to the swirl–EM coupling. In fact, $G_{\circlearrowright}$ could be looked at as an analogue of a gravitomagnetic coefficient but in electromagnetic disguise. There have been historical suggestions of connections between rotation and magnetism (e.g. Wilson \& Wilson (1913) experiment, or various "vortex electrodynamics" ideas), though none confirmed in standard physics. SST offers a concrete framework and a specific constant $\Phi_0$ where this might appear.


From the field equations perspective, if we augment Maxwell’s equations with the new term, the modified Faraday’s law (with $\mathbf{n}$ the normal vector for swirl density direction) can be written as:

\begin{equation}

\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{ \partial t} + \nabla \times \mathbf{E}\Big|\textit{\text{swirl}},,

\end{equation}

where $\nabla \times \mathbf{E}|{\text{swirl}} = G_{\circlearrowright} \partial_t \varrho_{\circlearrowright}, \mathbf{\hat{n}}$. The appearance of $\partial_t \varrho_{\circlearrowright}$ means the set of Maxwell equations is augmented by a source term in Faraday’s law (while Gauss’s law and Ampère’s law remain standard aside from the presence of induced currents when vortices move charged particles, etc.). One might think of this as an effective coupling between the $B$-field and the $B_{\mu\nu}$ fluid field in the Lagrangian formalism. Indeed, cross-terms like $B_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ (with $F^{\mu\nu}$ the electromagnetic field tensor) are conceivable in an effective action, which would yield coupling between fluid vorticity changes and electromagnetic fields. In our formalism, we did not explicitly include such a term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Lagrangian}, but a term like $G_{\circlearrowright} B_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ could effectively produce the modified induction. However, one must be cautious to preserve gauge invariances.


The predictions spelled out by Eq.~\eqref{eq:FaradayIntegralModified} are tested by envisioning experiments. We detail some in Sec.~8, but one canonical proposal is: Place a conducting loop (or a superconducting quantum interference device, SQUID) so that it can link a region where we can controllably introduce or remove a vortex. For example, in a superfluid or type-II superconductor, vortices are quantized and their movement through a coil yields a known signal (in SC, that signal is $\Phi_0$ in fact, which is how $\Phi_0$ is measured). SST suggests doing a similar thing with ``vacuum vortices.'' Since we cannot easily manipulate vacuum vortices, we simulate the vacuum by another condensate (e.g. a Bose–Einstein condensate of ultracold atoms or a Josephson junction array) and look for the predicted signals. If a single vortex enters the area of a pickup loop, SST predicts an induced voltage spike corresponding to one flux quantum. If one fails to detect such quantized impulses under conditions where they should occur, that could constrain or falsify the theory by limiting $G_{\circlearrowright}$ to be very small (perhaps zero, meaning no coupling).


It is remarkable that $G_{\circlearrowright}$ is not an independent free parameter in SST; it’s fixed to $\Phi_0$. This lends itself to precise tests, since $\Phi_0$ is a known quantity. In terms of units, $G_{\circlearrowright}\partial_t \varrho_{\circlearrowright}$ has units of Tesla (if $\partial_t \varrho$ is s$^{-1}$m$^{-2}$). To get a sense: if one vortex appears in an area of 1~m$^2$ over 1~microsecond, $\partial_t \varrho_{\circlearrowright} \sim 1/(10^{-6},\text{s}) = 10^6 ,\text{s}^{-1}$ per m$^2$. Multiply by $\Phi_0 \approx 2\times10^{-15}$~Wb and recall $1$ Weber per square meter is $1$ Tesla, the induced $\nabla\times E$ is $2\times10^{-9}$~T. For a loop of radius $0.1$~m, the EMF would be $\sim 2\times10^{-9} \times \pi(0.1)^2$ V$\approx 6\times10^{-11}$ V (integrated over microsecond might give an impulse of order $6\times10^{-17}$ V$\cdot$s, which is $\Phi_0$). These are small signals, but with sensitive SQUIDs or low-noise amplifiers, detecting $\Phi_0$ jumps is achievable since that's exactly what SQUIDs detect in superconductors. So the feasibility is there if a system can be found to produce single-vortex events reliably.


To summarize this section: SST extends Maxwell’s equations by including the influence of the topology of the vacuum condensate on electromagnetic fields. The central theoretical result is a \textbf{modified Faraday law} with an extra term $G_{\circlearrowright} \partial_t \varrho_{\circlearrowright}$. The coupling constant is identified with the quantum of flux $h/2e$, linking this emergent effect to fundamental quantum EM units. The implication is that whenever swirl strings nucleate, reconnect, or annihilate, they will emit or absorb discrete packets of electromagnetic flux, leading to potentially observable voltage impulses. We will revisit the experimental angle of this in Sec.~8, but first, in Sec.~6 we discuss another facet of SST: chirality and how it relates to quantum measurement and violation of certain symmetries.


\section{Chirality and Quantum Measurement Dynamics}

Chirality—the geometric notion of handedness—plays a fundamental role in Swirl–String Theory. Unlike in the Standard Model where chirality is an abstract property of spinor fields and parity-violation is put in ``by hand'' in weak interactions, SST attributes chirality to the physical twisting of vortex loops in the medium. A \emph{chiral knot} in the fluid (one not superimposable on its mirror image) corresponds to a particle that can have a handedness (like a neutrino which in SM comes only as left-handed, might correspond to a twisted vortex of a certain sense). Moreover, the presence of a locally defined orientation for swirl rotation implies that certain processes may have a time-asymmetric bias depending on chirality.


In SST’s ontology, matter versus antimatter is distinguished precisely by opposite swirl chirality. A particle and its antiparticle are mirror-knotted vortices (one clockwise, one counter-clockwise in terms of circulation). While they have equal mass and (in SST) both cause gravitational attraction, they would have opposite topological orientation. This opens the question: could physical processes distinguish between these orientations? In a purely isotropic, parity-symmetric universe, perhaps not easily. But if an experiment involves a chiral setup (like circularly polarized light, or a chiral molecule), then an asymmetry might emerge.


\subsection{Swirl Clock Orientation and Time Asymmetry}

One intriguing consequence of swirl chirality is the concept of a direction-dependent time rate, which has been dubbed the \emph{``swirl clock'' orientation effect}. Imagine an electron represented by a chiral knotted vortex. That vortex defines a local swirl axis and orientation. Now consider ionizing this electron from an atom with circularly polarized light. Experiments (e.g. by Han \textit{et al.} 2025 \cite{Han2025}) have observed that when they ionize chiral molecules with attosecond UV pulses, the ejected electrons show a forward/backward asymmetry in their emission timing of order tens of attoseconds, which flips sign between enantiomers (mirror-image molecules). This suggests the electron’s ejection dynamics somehow “knows” the molecular chirality. SST provides a natural narrative: the electron swirl string has a built-in clock that runs slightly faster along one direction of its circulation than the opposite direction if the circulation is chiral. In essence, a clockwise swirling electron might leave a molecule faster in one direction than its mirror (counter-clockwise) would.


To formalize, consider the local proper time defined previously, but now the possibility that $S_t$ might differ for opposite directions along the vortex. If the vortex has an intrinsic angular momentum or internal flow, one could imagine a slight shift: $S_{\circlearrowright}(t)$ vs $S_{\circlearrowleft}(t)$ for the two chiral orientations. The difference would be extremely tiny because it might come from higher-order effects (maybe related to the $\chi_h$ helicity coupling term in the Lagrangian, which we mostly set aside). But in a cumulative process like photoionization, it could translate to a measurable delay.


SST postulates that \emph{reversing the swirl clock orientation flips the sign of certain time delays}. In other words, if a process yields a time delay $\Delta t_{\text{FB}}$ (forward minus backward emission time) for a given chirality, then if we had the opposite chirality (mirror image setup or antiparticle), we would see $-\Delta t_{\text{FB}}$. This is exactly what Han et al. observed with methyl oxirane enantiomers: one enantiomer had +60~as delay, the other -60~as, for forward vs backward photoelectron emission. SST can interpret this by saying: the molecule’s handedness and the electron’s swirl handedness either align or anti-align, producing a slight difference in how quickly the electron’s phase accumulates as it exits, amounting to a path difference of order angstrom ($v_e \Delta t$ yields about 0.5~Å for 60~as with $v_e$ near some fraction of $c$). This path difference is like the swirl clock causing one orientation to effectively take a longer route (hence delay) compared to the other. In Appendix~B or C, we could derive a toy model: if an electron’s swirl gives it an internal Larmor clock that is sensitive to orientation relative to some field, one might get a slight phase shift.


The key point is that chirality in SST is a real, dynamic property, not just a label. A chiral swirl string has a built-in preferred direction (like a screw thread). When it interacts with a chiral environment or field (like circularly polarized light, which itself has helicity), the interaction rates can differ. This is conceptually similar to how in conventional physics, ionization yields phase differences (the continuum-continuum phase in RABBITT experiments), but those models need to add a subtle Coulomb-laser coupling term to explain the chirality effect. SST provides an alternative: the “Swirl Clock” concept says that the proper time of the electron’s departure depends on matching or opposing the swirl orientation to the process direction.


\subsection{Wavefunction Collapse as Vortex Topology Change}

Another aspect where SST sheds light is the process of quantum measurement. In the standard Copenhagen interpretation, measurement causes a wavefunction to collapse to an eigenstate, an abrupt non-unitary change. In pilot-wave or spontaneous collapse theories, one looks for a physical mechanism. SST identifies measurement (or generally decoherence) with the transition of a swirl string from R-phase to T-phase (Postulate~5). The R-phase (wave-like) is a diffuse, extended vortex with possibly multiple topologically ambiguous loops (think of it as not knotted or perhaps a trivial loop that can interfere with itself). The T-phase (particle-like) is a definite knotted state with a particular topological quantum number.


A \emph{quantum measurement} in SST is thus when the swirl string “decides” on a particular knotted configuration out of a superposition. How would this happen dynamically? Likely through an instability triggered by interaction with the environment (the measurement apparatus or ambient medium fluctuations). Mathematically, one could model the extended vortex as a superposition of small vortex loops or excitations, and a perturbation could cause it to nucleate a knot (like tying itself up). Once knotted, the circulation localizes and you effectively have a particle detected at some location (the location where the knot forms).


This picture allows us to compute things like decoherence rates. Indeed, in snippet [2], we saw an expression (Eq. (10) in that text) for $\Gamma_{R\to T}$ (the rate of R-to-T transitions) in terms of an integral of some susceptibility $\chi(r,\omega)$, some disturbance $u(r,\omega)$, etc. While we won’t delve into those details here, it indicates SST can produce an equation analogous to the Caldeira-Leggett or decoherence integrals, where the environment coupling $\chi$ and spectral function $F(\Delta K,\omega)$ yield an exponential decay of interference visibility $V$: $-\ln V = \text{(interaction time)} \times \text{(integral of coupling)}$. This matches known results in decoherence theory (where $-\ln V \propto$ time * interaction strength), showing SST’s model can reduce to standard decoherence in a regime.


What SST adds is the interpretation that what we call ``collapse'' is literally a topological change. The probability of a particular outcome corresponds to the probability the vortex ties into a specific knot vs another. Born’s rule (that probability is $|\psi|^2$) might emerge from ergodicity or ensemble considerations of the fluid dynamics. In fact, one could imagine that the amplitude of the wavefunction corresponds to the distribution of vortex circulation in space. When a knot forms, it will form where that distribution had most weight, which effectively yields the $|\psi|^2$ rule. This is speculative but offers a mechanism: the denser the swirl circulation in a region (like the intensity of the wavefunction), the more likely the vortex loop snaps into a knot there when disturbed.


Chirality could play a role in measurement as well. For example, if a measuring device itself has a chiral bias (imagine a piece of apparatus that interacts differently with clockwise vs counterclockwise circulating currents), it might preferentially trigger collapse of one handedness of loop. Perhaps this relates to why the weak interaction (responsible for certain measurements like detecting neutrinos) only sees left-handed particles: maybe the weak interaction, being essentially a chiral environment (W bosons couple only to left-handed fermions), only ``collapses'' vortices of one handedness. This is a tantalizing connection: parity violation in weak decays might be explained not as fundamental asymmetry but as a property of how swirl knots interact with the medium’s SU(2) fields (the $U_2$ director field in Table~III of snippet [7], which might spontaneously break symmetry in a handed way).


While these ideas are currently at a qualitative stage, SST provides a framework to discuss them. Chirality is not just an abstract quantum number but a geometrical property that can influence dynamics and outcomes.


\subsection{Parity and Time-Reversal in SST}

Because SST has a built-in asymmetry via chirality (matter vs antimatter are mirror images), one might wonder how $P$ (parity) and $T$ (time reversal) symmetries manifest. The core fluid laws (Navier–Stokes in an inviscid form, or Euler’s equations) are basically invariant under parity (flip orientation of space, a vortex of given chirality becomes the opposite chirality, which would correspond to swapping matter and antimatter perhaps). So one expects that the fundamental equations don’t prefer one chirality. However, the existence of a nonzero $\theta$ helicity term in the Lagrangian can spontaneously break $P$ or $T$ if $\theta$ is nonzero, since $W\tilde{W}$ is a total derivative but selecting a branch might favor one helicity sector (like giving an energy difference to knots vs anti-knots). In canonical SST, they set $\chi_h$ (helicity coupling) to zero to keep no helical bias. That means the theory itself does not prefer left or right globally. But it does allow stable chiral solutions (the knots).


Time reversal $T$ would correspond to reversing all swirl circulations (essentially taking $\kappa$ to $-\kappa$ and running flows backwards). If $\kappa$ maps to $h/m_{\mathrm{eff}}$, then $-\kappa$ corresponds to antiparticles with opposite circulation. If the pre-physical Axiom~0 had a symmetry $\Gamma \to -\Gamma$ implying every allowed state has an anti-state, then $T$ symmetry at fundamental level may correspond to exchanging matter with antimatter plus reversing motion. SST likely respects $CPT$ as any local field theory does, but how each operation is realized physically is interesting: $C$ (charge conjugation) presumably corresponds to swapping the sign of some topological quantum numbers (maybe linking number sign), $P$ corresponds to mirror-image knot (the enantiomer of the knot), and $T$ corresponds to running vortex flows backward (which for a vortex is like looking at an anti-vortex). So $C$, $P$, $T$ in SST are essentially operations on knot topology and flow orientation. If any of these is not an exact symmetry (as we know $P$ and $CP$ are not in weak interactions), it suggests maybe the vacuum has a subtle helicity imprint (maybe from initial conditions of the universe) or that the weak interaction background field ($U_2$ field from Table~III possibly) chooses a handedness. It's conceivable that $CP$ violation in particle physics could be traced to a small global swirl chirality (a kind of rotating cosmology or helicity bias in the early universe fluid). These are speculative but illustrate SST’s potential to address questions normally left to abstract quantum field theory.


In conclusion, SST’s treatment of chirality and measurement provides a fresh perspective: it anchors these phenomena in tangible fluid dynamics. Chirality leads to real, testable asymmetries (as in attosecond photoemission delays), and measurement is understood as a physical topological transition in the vacuum. If future experiments confirm, for example, the predicted flip of time delays with swirl orientation or find evidence of handedness in fundamental processes consistent with SST’s mechanism, it would lend support to this framework. Next, we will address how SST quantizes its spectrum of excitations in a canonical way and yields concrete values for observable quantities like particle masses.


\section{Canonical Quantization and Topological Spectrum}

SST departs from conventional quantum theory by proposing that quantization arises not from imposing commutation relations on fields, but from the discrete nature of allowed vortex configurations. In a sense, SST is a \emph{pre-quantized} theory: many quantities are inherently quantized (circulation, knot topology, linking number) at the classical level of the fluid due to topological constraints. This means the spectrum of possible states is inherently discrete, and when we linearize to get an effective field theory, those discrete values manifest as quantum numbers. In this section, we outline how quantization in SST is achieved and how it yields a spectrum of particle properties that align with observed values.


\subsection{Circulation Quantization and Combinatorial Spectrum}

The fundamental quantized quantity in SST is the circulation $\Gamma = n\kappa$. This is analogous to quantized flux in a superconductor or quantized circulation in superfluid helium, which are well-established experimentally \cite{Onsager1949, Feynman1955}. Because $n$ is an integer, any vortex loop can only carry integer multiples of $\kappa$. In practice, $n=1$ is expected for stable elementary particles (higher $n$ might correspond to multiple overlapping windings, possibly an excited state or unstable resonance). Thus, effectively each elementary swirl string carries the same magnitude of circulation quantum $\kappa$ (with direction distinguishing particle vs antiparticle). This already gives us a quantum condition akin to $\oint \vswirl \cdot d\ell = h/m_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which resembles the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization if one considers $m_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a medium property (SST has $m_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a parameter to set scales).


Next, the restriction to distinct knot types means the state space is combinatorially limited. There are only certain knots with crossing numbers up to a given complexity. If each corresponds to a particle, then one can enumerate them: unknot, trefoil, figure-8 ($4_1$ knot), etc, maybe correspond to known or unknown particles. SST’s canonical taxonomy (Postulate~6) gave a mapping to standard model particles:


\begin{itemize}
  \item Unknotted loops $\Rightarrow$ gauge bosons (e.g., photon; gluons might be different twists of unknots; W/Z could be small loops with internal structure).
  \item Simple torus knots ($3_1$, $4_1$, etc.) $\Rightarrow$ leptons.
  \item Chiral knots ($5_2$, $6_1$, etc.) $\Rightarrow$ quarks.
  \item Linked composites $\Rightarrow$ baryons and nuclei.
\end{itemize}

One can attempt to assign each known particle to a topology. The snippet~[20], lines~656--669, does exactly that for first generation matter. This is a bold hypothesis, but it can be tested in a limited sense: does the count of distinct knot types correspond to the multiplicity of particles? For example, torus knots: $3_1$ (trefoil) for electron, perhaps $5_1$ or $7_1$ (higher torus knots) for muon, tau? Indeed, snippet~[3], line~523, suggests $5_1$ knot is a ``higher lepton candidate'', possibly the muon, and $7_1$ maybe tau. Similarly, for quarks: $5_2$ for up, $6_1$ for down; what about strange, charm? Possibly $7_2$ or $8_1$ etc.\ (just speculating, the doc snippet~[0], lines~81--87, mentions up $= 5_2$, down $= 6_1$, and suggests $7_1$ maybe for strange/charm or a higher torus for those). It's plausible to extend this logic: each generation corresponds to adding crossings or complexity. Actually, [0], lines~79--87, indicates:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $5_2$ (twist knot with 5 crossings) $=$ up quark,
  \item $6_1$ (twist knot with 6 crossings) $=$ down quark,
  \item $7_1$ (torus knot with 7 crossings) might correspond to strange/charm (though it says ``higher-generation quark (strange/charm)'' at $7_1$).
\end{itemize}

This mapping is attractive because it organizes the particle spectrum by topology rather than an arbitrary generation index. If correct, it suggests relationships between masses: e.g., the mass difference between up and down quarks (which is known to be a few MeV) should correlate with some difference in their knot invariants ($5_2$ vs.\ $6_1$ have different topological properties).

Indeed, SST attempts to derive the mass spectrum via a topological mass functional as introduced in Sec.~3 and shown around Eq.~\eqref{eq:massFunctional}. That functional basically says $m_K^{(\text{sol})} = M_0 \Xi_K$ with $\Xi_K$ capturing things like total length of vortex $\ell_K$, average curvature, linking numbers, etc. In snippet~[18], they gave a heuristic derivation:

\begin{itemize}
  \item energy per length $\sim \frac{1}{2}\rhoF \Gamma^2 \ln(R/\rc)$, which for $\Gamma \sim v_\star \rc$ yields $\rhoF v_\star^2 \ell_K \ln(R/\rc)$,
  \item plus a volume energy $\rhoF v_\star^2 V_K$ for a knotted tube volume,
  \item plus maybe a coherence factor, etc.
\end{itemize}

They combine to something like
\[
\Xi_K = T_K \times \varphi^{2k}
\]
with $T_K$ a dimensionless tangle and $\varphi$ a factor for layering. They mention calibrating on electron, proton, neutron to fix constants. The fact that they can fit $e$, $p$, $n$ and then \emph{predict} other masses means SST passes a basic check: for example, it likely predicts the masses of muon, tau, or differences like $\Lambda$ baryon, etc., with some accuracy (they hinted errors of a few percent).

Notably, if the mapping to the Standard Model is one-to-one, then SST has no extra unknown particles beyond maybe one corresponding to knots that have no SM counterpart. If any stable knot has no known particle, that would be a prediction of a new particle. For example, what about the figure-eight knot ($4_1$)? It's an achiral knot (no handedness). Could that correspond to a hypothetical stable neutral boson? Possibly a candidate for dark matter or some sterile particle. In snippet~[3], lines~519--528, it lists 01: Unknot (photon), 31: torus-knot (electron), 41: achiral-knot (Candidate dark-sector knot). Yes, it explicitly mentions $4_1$: ``Achiral-knot: Candidate dark-sector knot''. So SST predicts perhaps a stable loop corresponding to the figure-eight knot which, because it's achiral, might not interact via the same chiral gauge forces (thus ``dark''). That could be a dark matter candidate with no SM charges, just gravitational interactions. Fascinatingly, an achiral composite would produce no far field swirl (SST notes non-chiral yields no net gravity far field). That fits the idea of dark matter: a form of matter that doesn't gravitate in the same way or is extremely weak. However, they said non-chiral yields no net far field thus no gravity, but dark matter clearly has gravity. Perhaps their ``dark-sector knot'' meant it might have mass but be hidden from EM/weak, not necessarily gravitationally inert.

Anyway, the topological spectrum doesn't only apply to masses, but also to charges and coupling strengths. SST suggests that charges (like electric charge quantization) might derive from linking numbers or intersection numbers of vortex fields with some background field (like the $U(1)$ phase field $\vartheta$ in Table~III, which might define a charge via how the knot winds around that internal phase). If so, the fact that electron and proton charges cancel exactly could be because their knots plus linking account for a net linking number of zero in a composite neutral atom. This is speculative but an example: the proton being 3 linked knots could have total linking that yields $+e$, and electron trefoil yields $-e$, linking them (like linking number negative cancels positive). Actually, if matter vs.\ antimatter differ by orientation, perhaps electron is a left-hand trefoil, positron a right-hand trefoil, and charge sign is tied to that orientation, which is a very intriguing idea: it means charge conjugation is just mirror image in knot sense. But then how to get 3 quark linking to yield exactly the opposite of an electron's linking? Possibly via the internal $U_3$, $U_2$ flux fields binding them (color flux in baryon $=$ linking number 3 maybe).

While the specifics await deeper development, SST's approach to quantization is essentially: \textbf{quantum numbers are topological numbers}. There is no need for a quantization postulate or a mystery as to why only certain values occur; the combinatorics of knot theory and boundary conditions enforce it.

One might ask: does SST reproduce the uncertainty principle and other hallmarks of quantum mechanics? Yes, in that an extended vortex R-phase has an inherent trade-off: if it's very well-defined in momentum (circulation), it's likely extended in space. In T-phase (localized knot), it has a definite position but then internally the circulation vector might be kind of not well-defined (maybe analogous to having internal spin uncertainty). The formal derivation of uncertainty is not trivial here, but one could attempt to map the equations of small excitations to a Schrödinger equation. Possibly, small oscillations of an unknotted loop are like a delocalized wavefunction, and when you restrict allowed modes by a boundary (like tying a knot imposes boundary conditions), that corresponds to localizing.

Another way canonical quantization enters is in the linear wave regime: if you linearize about a trivial vacuum, you'll find normal modes (phonons or photons) that can be quantized by usual means, yielding creation/annihilation operators for excitations of frequency $\omega$. This standard route would recover that, e.g., the photon mode is quantized in units of energy $\hbar\omega$, presumably because the fluid’s excitations carry momentum and energy in quantized lumps. However, importantly, these ``quanta'' are not fundamental random quanta; they are discrete because the underlying continuum has a countable set of modes.

SST’s canonical framework likely defines a Poisson bracket or Hamiltonian formulation for the fluid (which is well known for classical fluids; there's a Hamiltonian description with the Clebsch potentials or vorticity). Then imposing canonical commutation relations might not even be needed if the states are already discrete. But if one insisted on a field quantization, one could treat $B_{\mu\nu}$ and $W_\mu$ fields as quantum fields. The presence of stable solitons then implies a quantum Hilbert space that includes those soliton states. In that quantized field theory viewpoint, one would find a spectrum of bound states (like knotted flux tubes) possibly analogous to how in lattice QCD one finds glueball states or flux tube excitations. The big difference: those excitations are stable here due to topology, whereas in QCD flux tubes break (though QCD strings between quarks can't break because quarks are permanently attached; in SST maybe knot can't untie because of helicity conservation unless some energy is provided).

One consequence of the topological spectrum is that there might be relationships or selection rules for reactions. For example, if two vortex loops collide, to satisfy topological charge conservation, they might reconnect into new loops only if overall linking and knot numbers match. This could correlate to conservation laws like baryon number or lepton number. Indeed, baryon number might correspond to an invariant like ``3 times linking number mod something'' (since baryon is 3 quark knots linked, and maybe that linking number is conserved mod 3). If so, proton decay would require unraveling that composite link, which might be topologically forbidden without extremely high energy (so baryon number is effectively conserved unless extreme conditions). That fits with observed proton stability.

Another selection rule could involve spin: In SST, spin is related to how a knotted vortex rotates or twists. A trefoil has perhaps one unit of intrinsic angular momentum ($\hbar/2$). Two trefoils linked might produce an integer spin state, etc. Possibly it’s akin to how you can combine twist states. The details are open, but presumably it’s arranged to match spin-statistics: being knotted might impose fermionic behavior (trefoils are essentially twisted once, giving half-integer spin?), whereas unknotted loops are bosonic (photon is boson). If that holds, SST might naturally incorporate spin-statistics via topology: an unknotted loop has an even (or zero) twist, making it effectively a boson, whereas a knot has an odd half-twist requiring a $2\pi$ rotation to return to same configuration, yielding fermionic properties. If proven, that would be a major success (spin-statistics theorem from topology of fluid flow).

In summary, SST’s quantization is realized in a \textbf{canonical ensemble of discrete vortex states}. The allowed states are countable and correspond to quantum states we observe. The continuous symmetries (like phase rotations, isospin rotations of internal fields) yield conserved quantities (like charge, isospin) which are quantized by topological winding numbers. The discrete symmetries and exclusion (spin-statistics) come from whether a vortex configuration can be continuously deformed into another or not (for identical fermions, swapping two knotted loops might yield a sign change if one has to be rotated $360^\circ$ around the other to swap due to linking).

While many of these statements remain qualitative or conjectural within SST, the theory does produce at least one concrete outcome: a table of particle masses and quantum numbers that can be checked against reality. The authors of SST have done some of that calibration. If the predictions (for instance, predicting the neutron-proton mass difference, or the muon mass, etc.) are accurate, that is evidence in favor of the approach. Conversely, any glaring mismatch (like wrong mass ratios or missing a known particle) would be a problem. So far, the glimpses show encouraging correspondence within a few percent for leptons and nucleons.

Having laid out how SST conceptualizes quantization and obtains a topological spectrum of states, we now proceed to discuss concrete experiments that could validate or falsify various aspects of the theory.


\section{Experimental Implications \& Falsifiability}

A physical theory as radical as Swirl–String Theory must be subjected to experimental tests. SST is constructed to reproduce known phenomena in its domain of validity, but it also makes distinct predictions that depart from the Standard Model and general relativity. Here we highlight several key experimental implications of SST and how one might test them. These include: (I) quantized electromotive impulses from vortex events, (II) decay of quantum interference visibility due to finite vacuum vorticity, (III) structured photon propagation effects tied to knot chirality, and (IV) chiral-dependent time delays in photoemission (already discussed in Sec.~6). We also mention tests of emergent gravity (though those might be harder to isolate given gravity’s weakness). Crucially, each of these is \emph{falsifiable}: if careful experiments fail to observe the predicted effect where SST predicts it should occur, the theory would be tightly constrained or refuted. Conversely, observing one of these novel effects would provide strong evidence for SST’s underlying fluid medium.


\paragraph{I. Quantized Flux Impulses from Reconnection Events:}

Perhaps the most striking test is the prediction that whenever a swirl string is created, destroyed, or changes its linkage through a loop, an electromotive force impulse of magnitude $\Phi_0 = h/2e$ (one flux quantum) is induced (Sec.~5). To test this, one doesn’t need to literally create vortex loops in vacuum (which might be difficult), but one can simulate analogous conditions in a controlled setup. One proposed platform is a type-II superconductor or a superfluid: these systems are well described by quantum fluid dynamics and support quantized vortices (in superconductors, magnetic flux lines; in superfluids, flow vortices). We can arrange a superconducting pickup loop (part of a SQUID circuit, for example) and then trigger single vortex events in its vicinity. For instance, using a superconducting film adjacent to the loop: by applying a small magnetic field, one can coax exactly one vortex to enter the film through the loop (once the film’s critical field is just exceeded). When that vortex enters, the loop should register a sharp voltage spike corresponding to one flux quantum crossing it. Indeed, in superconductivity, such a signal is expected by standard physics because a vortex carries one flux quantum $\Phi_0$ and the SQUID is essentially measuring that (this is how SQUID magnetometers detect flux). However, here’s the key: SST expects that even in the absence of a pre-existing magnetic flux, a swirl vortex event (which in a superconductor is basically the same as a magnetic flux quantum event) produces that impulse. The real test is in a neutral superfluid (like a Bose–Einstein condensate of atoms) where quantized vortices carry circulation but not necessarily magnetic flux. If one could engineer a tiny loop of wire in a BEC and create or annihilate a single quantized vortex threading that loop, the moving vortex’s rotating frame should induce an electric field via the SST coupling. The predicted impulse is again $\Phi_0$ in magnitude. This is exotic because a neutral BEC vortex should not couple to electromagnetism in the Standard Model, yet SST says the analog coupling in the true vacuum would produce an EMF. Since we can’t directly test vacuum, using a BEC with maybe a synthetic gauge field might mimic it. Alternatively, one could attempt to observe in heavy-ion collisions or other violent processes if any sudden $\nabla \times E$ fields are generated without charges present (though that’s messy).


The superconducting version of the experiment is simpler and essentially amounts to measuring known flux quanta, which is more a proof-of-concept. The BEC or other condensed matter analogs are challenging but conceivable. If such experiments find no evidence of impulses (especially in conditions where SST would predict them), it could imply either $G_{\circlearrowright}$ is very small or zero in vacuum. However, one might argue that if we only test analog systems, we have to be cautious: a BEC might not exactly replicate vacuum SST coupling unless the coupling is truly universal. Possibly, it might require coupling BEC vortices to actual electromagnetism via some mechanism (maybe using an atom with large polarizability such that vortex rotation produces an effective magnetic moment).


Nevertheless, the general expectation is that if swirl strings exist, they will reveal themselves through this quantized EM coupling if we are clever enough to isolate such events. The impulse detection via SQUID is at least technologically feasible, as SQUIDs can easily detect single flux quanta. The main challenge is controlling the single-vortex events in a clean way and ensuring any measured signal isn’t just from known inductive coupling (in the superconductor case, it is known and expected; in a neutral fluid it would be new).


\paragraph{II. Interference-Visibility Decay from Finite-Amplitude Swirl:}

Another prediction mentioned in the Lagrangian paper’s abstract is that finite amplitude swirl flows can cause a decay in interference visibility. The idea is that if the vacuum (or experimental environment) isn’t perfectly still but has some residual swirl excitations, these can decohere quantum superpositions over time. In simpler terms, if a particle is in a double-slit experiment and the vacuum medium around it has turbulence or oscillations, those fluid perturbations can carry information about which path the particle took, thus reducing interference contrast.


This effect would manifest as a slight reduction in fringe visibility that worsens with time or with certain conditions (like if vacuum fluctuations of swirl are induced by a strong field). The user text suggests a concrete scenario: interference-visibility decay driven by finite-amplitude swirl. Possibly one could test this by doing electron double-slit experiments in environments of varying conditions. For example, if one could “stir” the vacuum by placing a spinning heavy mass or an electromagnetic field that might drag the vacuum a tiny bit, does it reduce coherence of electrons? Standard theory would say no if it doesn’t interact significantly. But SST might say yes, the swirl medium motion causes time dilation differences along the electron paths leading to phase jitter.


One way to check could be to use ultra-stable interferometers (like for neutrons or atoms) and see if rotation or motion of apparatus (or environment changes like temperature affecting vacuum modes) influences coherence beyond known effects. The challenge is to separate this from ordinary noise and vibrations. The effect might be subtle. The Lagrangian mention suggests that this is a concrete, parameter-free prediction: presumably, once we calibrate $\rhoF$ and $v_{\circ}$, we can estimate how a given swirl amplitude affects decoherence rate. The abstract enumerated it as II after flux impulses. It implies that if we had a known amplitude swirl (like a vortex of certain circulation in vicinity), it will cause a quantifiable exponential decay of interference fringe contrast.


No such effect is known in standard physics except if the vortex physically interacts (like air flow or fields scattering the particles). But here it would be a “frictionless” fluid’s effect.


This is reminiscent of random ether drift causing decoherence – an idea that was historically associated with stochastic gravity or something. But SST can put a number: maybe an amplitude of swirl corresponding to velocity $v$ yields a decoherence time $\tau$ inversely related to $v^2$ (just guessing, since higher $v$ -> more time dilation differences -> faster decoherence). If an experiment sees no such effect when $v$ is known (like rotating the apparatus at 1 m/s tangential speed), it sets an upper bound on $\rhoF$ or coupling.


Thus, interference experiments, particularly with massive particles or long coherence times, can constrain SST. For instance, interference of C$_{60}$ fullerene molecules has been done. If SST’s swirl medium had a density that caused any noticeable decoherence at those scales, it might have been seen. Possibly SST authors tuned parameters so that in normal conditions (no swirling flows), decoherence is negligible (consistent with observed long coherence lengths of, say, photons from distant stars, etc.). But if we artificially excite swirl flows, maybe by bounding a region with moving boundaries or intense laser fields, we could test if coherence is lost more rapidly than expected.


\paragraph{III. Skyrmionic Photon Textures (Polarization Patterns Indexed by Knot Chirality):}

The Lagrangian abstract mentions "skyrmionic photon textures indexed by knot chirality." This suggests that photons (or electromagnetic fields) might acquire complex polarization or phase patterns (like skyrmions in their field configuration) that depend on the chirality of the source or medium. Possibly, a knotted vortex could imprint a specific swirling polarization pattern on photons it emits. For example, maybe radiation from a knotted electron (like synchrotron radiation from a swirling electron vortex) has a distinctive polarization state.


An example might be: If an electron in SST is a trefoil knot, when it oscillates (emits a photon), the photon might carry not just spin-1 polarization, but a subtle topological phase (like optical vortices, where light can have phase singularities or orbital angular momentum). So SST might predict certain optical or gamma-ray emissions have spiral wavefront or polarization singularities that correlate with particle chirality. If one could measure the fine structure of light from certain atomic transitions or in scattering, one might find deviations like a small circular dichroism due to vacuum structure.


One accessible test: produce entangled photons from matter-antimatter annihilation or other processes and check if their polarization correlations reveal any pattern that could hint at underlying swirl structures. Or measure whether photon propagation in vacuum exhibits any self-rotation of polarization (birefringence) tied to global matter distribution. Standard QED says vacuum is not birefringent unless in fields (except in some quantum gravity ideas). SST might allow a scenario: if lots of swirl strings align (like a net helicity in cosmic structures), could that rotate polarization of traversing light (i.e. cosmic polarization rotation)? Possibly. That could be tested with astrophysical observations (light from distant galaxies through cosmic matter distribution – though that’s messy because cosmic dust etc also affects polarization).


Skyrmionic textures might also refer to the solutions of the $B$ field equation where a photon is represented as a twisted field configuration. In that case, measuring them would require mapping the field in space, which is not easy for real photons except via interferometry. But one could attempt to simulate in metamaterials or other analogs.


This prediction is less straightforward to test in a tabletop experiment. It sounds like something that might come out in specialized circumstances or under careful analysis of polarization patterns in high-intensity laser experiments (where vacuum polarization might reveal structure). At least, it's a potential distinctive feature to look for in photonic experiments.


\paragraph{IV. Attosecond Chirality-Sensitive Dynamics:}

We already covered this in Sec.~6: the photoionization delay experiments with chiral molecules \cite{Han2025}. Those results exist: enantiomers show opposite sign delays. Conventional theory can attribute those to subtle continuum scattering differences, but it’s somewhat surprising and has generated interest in “time-dependent chirality in photoionization.” SST offers an explanation and more importantly a prediction: if one could flip the swirl orientation of the electron artificially, it would flip the delay sign. We cannot flip an electron’s knot handedness easily (that’s like converting it to positron or something), but we can compare to maybe an antiparticle if similar experiments were possible (like photoionizing positronium or something with chiral environment? Hard to do). At least, the existence of this effect in molecules is a hint consistent with SST’s swirl clock idea.


To further test this aspect, one might try different molecules, different energies to see if the delay correlates with predicted path length differences. Or try to isolate whether it’s the vacuum property or molecular potential causing it. For example, in a purely achiral potential, SST would predict no forward-backward asymmetry (since swirl orientation doesn’t matter if environment symmetric). If one artificially introduces a chiral field (like a second laser with circular polarization in a known phase relation), does it amplify or invert the asymmetry? That could sort out how much is due to external fields vs internal swirl. At present, this line of investigation is already happening in attosecond science; SST provides a framework to interpret any anomalies or patterns in terms of a vacuum chirality effect.


\paragraph{Emergent Gravity Tests:}

While not enumerated in I--III, another big domain is testing the emergent gravity aspect. Some possible tests or constraints:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Does $G_{\text{swirl}}$ exactly equal $G_N$ for all conditions? Could there be deviations in strong fields? Perhaps look at precision Cavendish experiments or inverse square law tests at short ranges: if a swirl fluid has any slight compressibility or additional Yukawa-like behavior (via $\rc$ core smoothing potential), it might deviate at sub-mm scales. Experimentally, gravity has been tested down to mm or sub-mm; no deviation found yet, so SST must align with that.

  \item In orbital motion or frame dragging tests (Gravity Probe B, LIGO detection of gravitational waves), would SST predict the same phenomena? If gravitational waves in GR correspond to fluid vorticity waves in SST, maybe the polarization or speed might differ. LIGO sees GR-consistent polarization and speed $=c$. If SST's analog can be shown to replicate those, okay; if not, it's trouble. It might be hard to conceive how a fluid medium exactly reproduces the two polarization states of GR gravitational waves (which are quadrupolar, spin-2). Possibly, coherent excitations of swirl (coupled $B$ and $W$ fields) could mimic it. If not, gravitational wave observations could challenge SST.

  \item Matter vs.\ antimatter free-fall: Since SST says both have positive mass and attract, it predicts antimatter falls down just like matter (which is consistent with current best tests, e.g.\ the ALPHA experiment at CERN recently measured that antihydrogen falls with $g$ consistent with normal within $\sim$10\% or so uncertainty). If a future experiment found antimatter falls differently (say anti-H gravitating with different acceleration), that would break GR but also either break SST or force an adjustment (SST currently states matter/antimatter chirality doesn't affect gravitational energy, only swirl orientation flips sign but energy depends on $v^2$ so it's same). Right now, evidence suggests antimatter gravity is normal, which is consistent with SST.

  \item Tests of preferred frame: Since SST has an absolute frame (the swirl medium rest frame), there might be subtle violations of Lorentz invariance if one could detect motion relative to that medium. SST aims to be empirically Lorentz invariant for kinematics (like modern LETs are typically so exactly consistent that it's undetectable). But perhaps extremely sensitive clock comparisons or cosmic ray anisotropies might hint at an absolute rest frame. All 20th century Michelson--Morley type experiments put tight limits on any ether wind. For SST to survive, the swirl medium must either be exactly dragging along with Earth locally (which could be a boundary condition, like local comoving frame) or the coupling of matter to medium is such that no first-order effects appear. Possibly swirl medium flows around Earth (giving emergent gravity) also means Earth's frame is the rest frame at its location. Still, maybe cosmic frame (CMB rest frame) is the swirl medium on large scale. If so, tiny anisotropies in particle maximum speeds or something could appear. Modern tests (like comparing speed of light from different directions, or isotropy of inertia (Hughes--Drever experiments)) have not found any anisotropy beyond $10^{-18}$ level or so. That constrains any difference between swirl frame and Earth frame, implying swirl medium either perfectly drags or the coupling yields Lorentz invariance to high precision. Perhaps the preferred frame is only visible in second-order effects (like time dilation differences, which are small and usually gaugeable away).
\end{itemize}

SST authors probably argue it's completely consistent with Lorentz symmetry in all currently tested regimes (like any Lorentz Ether can be if the dynamics mimics SR exactly). But future more precise tests might push this further, e.g.\ searching for Lorentz violation in neutrino oscillations or such could indirectly challenge any underlying fixed frame.

\paragraph{Other Predictions:}

Beyond the ones enumerated, SST might have other signals:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Vacuum Cherenkov radiation: In some ether theories, if particles move faster than medium excitations, they'd radiate. If medium excitations speed $=c$, then normal matter at subluminal speeds no effect. But high-energy cosmic rays nearing $c$ -- any difference? If $c$ is exactly the medium wave speed, no vacuum Cherenkov (consistent with observation, no photon emission from cosmic ray in vacuum).

  \item Variation of constants: If SST's medium properties (like density $\rhoF$ or $\Phi_0$ coupling) vary with environment (temperature of vacuum, presence of fields), might fundamental constants vary slightly? E.g.\ speed of light or vacuum permittivity vary in gravitational potential (some theories like emergent gravity predict that). Could test with atomic clock comparisons at different gravitational potentials or electromagnetic fields. Current limits show if any variation, it's extremely small.

  \item Direct detection of the medium: It's a fluid, can we see any dissipative effect at extremely high frequencies or short scales? Perhaps at very short wavelengths, propagation might deviate from pure Maxwell (like dispersion or cutoff frequency if medium granular). E.g.\ if $m_{\text{eff}}$ or $\rc$ imposes a limit, maybe photons above certain frequency (like beyond some huge value) behave differently. Hard to test with present tech, but maybe cosmic gamma rays or neutrinos could reveal if vacuum not perfectly transparent or if there's friction. Observations of high-energy photons from GRBs etc.\ show they arrive within microseconds regardless of energy differences, up to TeV scale, limiting dispersion. That suggests if SST medium has any frequency-dependent wavespeed, it's extremely small up to that energy (which likely it is, since $\Phi_0$ being small implies extremely stiff medium at those scales).
\end{itemize}

Finally, it's worth noting falsifiability: If none of these predicted effects are observed, SST's parameter space shrinks to a trivial corner (where effectively it becomes just an interpretation with no new effects). If one effect is observed (like quantized impulses with no conventional explanation, or an unexplained decoherence or polarization effect), it would be a breakthrough supporting SST or similar ideas.

The philosophy here is commendable: SST does not hide behind ``we can always adjust to match experiments''---instead it lays out specific, parameter-fixed predictions I--III in the abstract, meaning the theory as formulated can be disproven.

In the next section, we will compare SST to other frameworks to highlight differences and similarities, before concluding.


\section{Comparison with Existing Frameworks}

Swirl–String Theory draws inspiration from numerous historical and contemporary frameworks, yet it differs in crucial ways. Here we compare SST with several related approaches: Kelvin’s vortex atom model, Madelung/Bohm hydrodynamic interpretations of quantum mechanics, analog gravity in fluids, string theory in high-energy physics, and the Standard Model plus General Relativity themselves. The goal is to situate SST in the landscape of theories, clarifying what it tries to improve or replace, and acknowledging where it must confront challenges already known in those frameworks.


\paragraph{Kelvin’s Vortex Atoms and Early Ether Theories:}

Lord Kelvin’s 19th-century idea proposed that atoms were knotted vortex rings in a luminiferous ether fluid \cite{Kelvin1867}. This remarkably prescient model shares with SST the notion of matter as stable vortex knots and of conservation of topology (Kelvin noted that vortex loops in an ideal fluid cannot break, which would explain atomic stability). SST can be seen as a modern resurrection of Kelvin’s idea, now informed by quantum theory and relativity. However, Kelvin’s model lacked a mechanism for different elements (how to get chemical properties, periodic table from knots was speculative) and was eventually abandoned as the electron and nucleus were discovered as more fundamental entities. SST addresses one shortcoming by providing a mapping of knots to the known particle zoo rather than to chemical atoms, and introduces the swirl medium as a Lorentzian ether (to respect relativity’s empirical success). Kelvin’s ether was a mechanical incompressible fluid filling space, and SST’s medium is essentially the same concept with a century and a half of additional physics layered on. Modern LETs were once considered superfluous since Einstein’s relativity can do without; SST counters that by giving the ether an active role (mass spectrum predictions, new coupling $G_{\circlearrowright}$, etc.). Unlike static classical ethers, SST’s condensate is a dynamic field that reproduces all of relativistic kinematics (much like Lorentz and Poincaré’s formulation but with a way to hide the absolute frame practically). In summary, SST embraces the spirit of Kelvin’s vortex atoms but places them in a comprehensive effective field theory context, aiming to overcome the criticisms that doomed older ether theories (lack of explanatory power and conflict with Michelson-Morley results).


\paragraph{Hydrodynamic Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics:}

Louis de Broglie and Erwin Madelung in the 1920s showed that the Schrödinger equation for a particle could be rewritten as fluid equations (Madelung’s hydrodynamic form) with a quantum potential term, suggesting perhaps quantum behavior could be understood as a form of fluid flow \cite{Madelung1926}. Later, David Bohm’s pilot-wave theory also invoked a real wave guiding particles, analogous to a fluid wave. More recently, experiments with oil droplets bouncing on vibrating fluid surfaces (Couder’s experiments) produced pilot-wave-like behavior, giving credence to a “quantum analog” fluid picture. SST shares with these the notion that a real fluid underlies quantum phenomena and that wave–particle duality can be visualized (in SST, the R-phase vs T-phase is analogous to pilot-wave guiding fluid vs localized droplet). The difference is that SST is far more ambitious: it’s not just an interpretation of quantum mechanics, it’s a full field theory claiming to produce gravity and other forces too. Madelung’s equations still needed an external quantum potential to match quantum mechanics; SST instead tries to derive the effective quantum potential (for example, the “quantum pressure” term in Madelung is replaced by fluid pressure effects from vortices in SST). Another difference: in pilot-wave theory, particles are pointlike with an associated guiding wave; in SST, the particle is the wave (when unknotted) or becomes localized as a soliton (knotted). There is no separate guiding wave vs particle, it’s the same entity in two regimes. This possibly avoids some conceptual pitfalls of pilot-wave (like what fundamentally is the guiding wave if not a physical field). On the flip side, pilot-wave theory is explicitly nonlocal (the guiding wave responds instantaneously in some formulations to enforce quantum correlations), whereas SST’s interactions are all local in the medium (though topologically they can produce nonlocal correlations akin to entanglement—this area likely needs work in SST: can it naturally produce entanglement and Bell inequality violations? That’s a challenge for any realist theory. If two particles are two distant vortex loops that were once linked or have correlated medium excitations, maybe it can emulate entanglement. But ensuring no superluminal signaling while having a medium is tricky. The authors likely claim the medium’s excitations are limited to $c$, so any correlation must be established at co-creation of entangled state and then just manifest as correlated outcomes without message sending. This is plausible if the state of the medium that connects them is nonlocally correlated but not transferring info faster than $c$. In any case, SST has to reproduce all quantum correlation results that standard QM does, or it will be falsified).


Overall, SST can be viewed as a synthesis of the hydrodynamic interpretation (for quantum phenomena) and topological soliton ideas (for particle stability), taking them to a unified extreme.


\paragraph{Analogue Gravity and Emergent Spacetime:}

In the early 2000s, a program of “analogue gravity” studied how various condensed matter systems (superfluids, Bose–Einstein condensates, electromagnetic waveguides, etc.) can reproduce phenomena of curved spacetime and black holes \cite{Barcelo2011}. For instance, a moving fluid can have sound horizons analogous to event horizons (as in the famous Unruh sonic black hole). SST aligns with analogue gravity in that it too asserts gravity is not fundamental but emergent from something more basic (in SST, fluid pressure gradients). The difference is analogue gravity usually doesn’t claim the fluid is real spacetime—only a laboratory model to gain intuition—whereas SST says the fluid is the real thing. Some emergent gravity proponents (e.g. Ted Jacobson \cite{Jacobson1995} or Erik Verlinde \cite{Verlinde2011}) have suggested that Einstein’s equations might be equations of state of some unknown microstructure of spacetime (like thermodynamics emerging from atoms). SST provides a candidate for that microstructure. It achieves emergent Newtonian gravity clearly (Sec.~4), and presumably could recover aspects of GR in some limit (though to fully get Einstein’s field equations may require more in SST, e.g. the swirl medium’s perturbations might mimic gravitational waves only in linear approximation but not all strong-field phenomena—this remains to be validated). Compared to other emergent gravity models (entropic gravity, quantum graphity, etc.), SST is a classical continuum theory, which is an advantage in clarity but potentially a drawback since quantizing gravity is replaced by just the fluid (so quantum gravity puzzles shift to fluid dynamics puzzles). But SST doesn’t attempt to quantize spacetime, rather spacetime is a stage for fluid dynamics.


One should mention also the classical “fluid-mechanical model of ether” that was once considered for GR (e.g. theories by Dirk Jan Brouwer or others who tried to get Einstein equations from a fluid). Those didn’t fully succeed. SST might succeed at least in the Newtonian regime by design. But if confronted with tests like gravitational light bending (which in GR comes from spacetime curvature), will SST get the right deflection? Possibly yes, if one considers that light in SST is a wave in the medium, passing through a low pressure region around a mass, it might bend akin to a refractive index gradient. In fact, one can derive light bending in a potential by treating space as having an effective refractive index $n(r)$; SST’s swirl potential $V_{\text{SST}}(r)$ might induce an $n(r) > 1$ inside gravitational wells (because local light speed might be lower where swirl energy density is high, due to $S_t$ factor). This could yield lensing. That is an avenue to check: does SST predict correct lensing (which is twice the Newtonian deflection)? If the medium slows light by the right amount (given $S_t = \sqrt{1- v^2/c^2}$ for local time, an observer at infinity would see time (and thus light speed) reduced near mass, causing bending equivalently to GR’s). If it only got half the deflection, then it fails. But likely the pressure effect yields effectively a curved space metric (Painlevé-Gullstrand form maybe). The authors should ensure that: emergent gravity in SST beyond Newtonian.


Nevertheless, in spirit, SST supports the emergent spacetime paradigm strongly: geometry is an epiphenomenon of fluid flows, not fundamental.


\paragraph{Superstring Theory and Topological Solitons:}

It’s somewhat ironic that SST shares the word “string theory” but is almost opposite in philosophy to the mainstream string theory. Superstring theory posits fundamental one-dimensional strings vibrating in a fixed background or in a dynamically curved spacetime, aiming to unify all particles and gravity in a quantum framework. SST, by contrast, has strings as literal vortex loops in a classical fluid; they are composite/excitations, not fundamental Planck-scale strings. The only commonality is usage of topology: both have various winding and vibrational modes. But SST’s knots vs superstring’s oscillation modes correspond to quantum numbers differently. Also, SST operates at low energy/low velocity for emergent gravity, whereas superstring works at ultra-high energy to unify gravity with quantum. In some sense, SST is a competitor to high-energy unification: it claims you don’t need to quantize gravity or introduce Planck-scale strings to get a unified description of forces—just use classical fluid and emergent fields. This is radical, and many physicists would be skeptical that a low-energy EFT (effectively) could hold at arbitrarily high energy. For instance, what happens at LHC energies or beyond? Does the fluid picture still hold, or do we see evidence of substructure? If SST is correct, maybe at some high energy or small scale, new phenomena (like vacuum turbulence or dispersion of propagation) might show up. If nothing shows up up to $10^{19}$ GeV, one might then accept the fluid as fundamental. But if new stuff appears (like string theory predicts new particles, supersymmetry, extra dimensions), that could contradict SST if not accounted for. So far, LHC hasn’t found new fundamental particles beyond Standard Model. That might not support SST per se, but it doesn’t contradict it either. If one day an electron substructure is observed (like form factor deviations), one might tie that to size of a vortex core ($r_c$ maybe ~ $10^{-15}$ m yields some effect at momentum $1/r_c$ scale $\sim$ a few TeV maybe). It would be interesting if future accelerators see evidence of finite size of leptons or internal structure that could align with a vortex model.


Topological solitons have appeared in various quantum field contexts (e.g. Skyrmions for nucleons, hopfion solutions in certain nonlinear sigma models, etc.). SST is akin to a Skyrme-like model but in a physical fluid rather than an abstract field. It benefits from that because fluids naturally allow knotted vortex solutions that are hard to achieve in simpler field models (usually requiring higher order terms or special conditions). So SST’s success might hinge on leveraging known stable vortex phenomena. On the flip side, control of those solutions mathematically is tough; one may rely on numerics or analogies rather than closed-form solutions. But if one can numerically demonstrate a knotted vortex is stable in the SST equations with exactly the right mass, that would be a big milestone.


\paragraph{Standard Model and GR:}

Finally, how does SST compare to just using the Standard Model (SM) and General Relativity (GR)? The SM+GR is extremely well-tested in their domains. SST must reproduce their successes where applicable: quantum electrodynamics, nuclear forces (if SST has analogs for weak and strong interactions via the emergent gauge fields $W_\mu^a$ perhaps representing SU(3) color etc.), and gravitational tests. The main motivation for SST is to provide a more unified and explanatory picture (e.g. why masses are what they are, why quantum is weird, etc.), and to be a \emph{testable} alternative (predicting new physics rather than just adding epicycles). It also aims to be a realist interpretation, removing the mystery of wavefunction collapse, etc.


One advantage: SM has 19+ free parameters (masses, mixing angles). SST tries to cut that down drastically (maybe to a handful: $\rhoF$, $v_{\circ}$, some geometric factors in mass functional). If indeed SST can predict masses within few percent, that’s something SM cannot do inherently (it just inputs them from experiment). Similarly, if SST can naturally explain why we see 3 generations of fermions (knot complexity up to some limit yields 3 sets? Or maybe more but higher knots unstable or correspond to very heavy states that decayed early?), that addresses a puzzle SM leaves open.


However, SST also introduces new constants like $\kappa$, $m_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (though those combine to physical ones anyway), $G_{\circlearrowright}$ (which turned out to be $h/2e$ by identification, interestingly not a new independent constant but linking known ones), and medium properties (like $\rhoF$ which might be chosen such that $c = 1/\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0}$ emerges correctly, so $\rhoF$ is effectively fixed by that requirement if we identify $\rhoF = \varepsilon_0$ from earlier). Possibly $\rhoF$ is determined by requiring $G_{\text{swirl}} = G_N$ as well in combination with $v_{\circ}$ and $\rc$. The table in snippet [7] lines 4027-4036 says $\rhoF$ is calibrated to $10^{-7}$ (some units) for dimensional consistency and acts like $\varepsilon_0$, and $\rhoM$ is defined via it. So $\rhoF$ might be $10^{-7}$ kg/m$^3$? If that’s in SI, it’s an extremely low density (like one-tenth of a microgram per cubic meter), which is so small that being undetectable physically is plausible. A medium that thin would be harder to detect than interstellar gas, and if it's non-viscous, it wouldn’t slow planets or satellites (the classic ether wind drag arguments) because the coupling is only through gravity or EM subtle terms. Good.


Comparing how SM does things: forces by exchange particles vs SST: forces by fluid flow patterns. For electromagnetic force, SM says photons carry force, SST says two charged knots create pressure/velocity field patterns that push/pull (like two swirl rings in a smoke might push each other via induced flows—one might recall vortex ring interactions are interesting: coaxial vortex rings can attract or repel depending on orientation, akin to electromagnetic forces if you interpret something as “charge” or "current loops"). Possibly SST’s emergent $W_\mu$ gauge field yields something similar to non-Abelian gauge boson exchange effectively.


One major difference: SM’s weak and strong forces are short-range (weak has massive bosons, strong confines). In SST, short-range could come from medium effects like vortex cores and alignment fields (like the director fields $U_2, U_3$ introduced perhaps give Yukawa-like contact terms for knots linking/unlinking). The Lagrangian abstract did mention “parity-violating and contact terms enabling vertices analogous to Yukawa and weak couplings.” So they have put in some explicit terms to mimic weak force (parity violation means the medium can have a small helical term, or the swirl connection picks out handedness? Possibly their $\chi_h$ was a term to allow that but set to 0 for canonical theory, though if nonzero would break parity slightly, that could mimic weak interaction which is parity-violating). And “contact term for Yukawa coupling” suggests a term that directly couples three fields to simulate how quark knots might exchange something (maybe an instanton-like term when three vortex strands meet, akin to baryon-quark interactions?).


If SST can incorporate all these, it basically becomes an alternate formulation of SM (plus gravity) with fewer free parameters and a clearer ontology. But the risk is it could become as baroque as SM if many extra terms are needed to fit all details (like adding by hand a term to mimic each gauge interaction might seem just an elaborate rewrite rather than a true reduction of complexity). The authors likely aimed to derive as much as possible from minimal assumptions. Still, they did allow some extra terms (like $\theta$ term, $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ constraints, etc. in Lagrangian—some might worry these are analogous to adding potential by hand or fine-tuning to get right results).


In any event, from a pragmatic perspective, SST will ultimately be judged by:


\begin{itemize}
  \item Does it predict new phenomena (and do those occur)?
  \item Does it reduce conceptual problems (like unify concepts, solve hierarchy of masses, clarify quantum weirdness) in a satisfying way?
\end{itemize}

We have enumerated how it attempts those. If experiments show, e.g., the flux impulse or a specific mass prediction pans out, it gains credibility.

Conversely, if an effect like no sign of vacuum-induced decoherence or a clear violation of isotropy at some level is seen, that could challenge SST.

One comparative note: It's somewhat like a classical or hidden-variable theory underneath quantum---such approaches historically face Bell's theorem issues. SST’s nonlocal connections (via the medium’s topological links) might circumvent Bell locality assumptions by having the ``hidden variables'' (like relative phases or linking in the medium) established at creation of entangled pair. If done carefully, it might reproduce QM’s predictions while maintaining an objective reality of sorts.

No analog of fermion exchange antisymmetry has been explicitly discussed here except noting that knots might encode spin-statistics. If SST fails to produce the Pauli exclusion principle naturally, it falls down (because we see that principle in matter structure). Possibly having an odd linking with the $\theta$ term could give minus signs under $360^\circ$ rotation or exchange---this is subtle to evaluate.

Finally, one should mention: a challenge for any ether theory is stability and isotropy of the cosmic rest frame. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides a reference frame (the frame in which CMB is isotropic). Earth moves at $\sim 370$~km/s relative to CMB. If swirl medium is at rest with CMB, Earth is moving a bit relative to it. That speed is $10^{-3}c$. Michelson--Morley experiments limit anisotropy in light speed to parts in $10^{-15}$, which would correspond to any effect of order $(v/c)^2 \approx 10^{-6}$ suppressed by $10^{-9}$ more beyond naive expectation. Possibly SST says a uniform medium flow has no effect on experiments because only swirling (rotational) motion matters, or that electromagnetic wave equations are Lorentz invariant up to second order automatically (like in Lorentz ether, you can’t detect first-order because matter contracts etc., only second order which might be too small to measure at 370~km/s with old experiments, but modern ones might catch second order). However, modern experiments like LIGO or atomic clocks might be able to see second-order anisotropy. The fact none is reported suggests if the medium exists, either it's exactly comoving with Earth locally (maybe entrained by gravitational potential---some ether theorists proposed gravitational entrainment of ether), or the effect is beyond current sensitivity.

In summary, compared to SM+GR, SST is more cumbersome in that it introduces a physical medium and complicated fluid dynamics, but it’s rewarding if it explains things SM+GR leave arbitrary (like mass values, quantum measurement). It's up against very tight experimental scrutiny though.


\section{Conclusion \& Outlook}

We have presented \textbf{Swirl--String Theory (SST)} as a comprehensive fluid-based reformulation of fundamental physics. In this model, all of particle physics and gravity emerge from the dynamics of a single classical medium permeating space. By treating particles as quantized vortex loops (\emph{swirl strings}) in an incompressible condensate, SST provides intuitive accounts of formerly mysterious phenomena: quantum duality arises from knotted vs.\ unknotted phases of these loops, inertia and gravity stem from fluid flows and pressure, and discrete quantum numbers correspond to topological invariants. We have shown how a Lagrangian framework can be constructed for this picture, embedding the postulates into a field theory that reproduces known physics in appropriate limits.

Several key results stand out:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Emergent Newtonian Gravity:} A pair of chiral vortex rings attract each other with an inverse-square law, and by calibrating the circulation quantum $\kappa$ and core size $\rc$, the effective gravitational constant matches $G_N$. This offers a concrete fluid mechanism underlying gravity: low pressure zones created by swirling matter pull masses together, in flat space but mimicking curved-space gravity to leading order (Appendix~C).
\item \textbf{Swirl-Induced Time Dilation:} Clocks tied to swirling motion tick slower by the factor $S_t=\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$, exactly as in special relativity. We derived this ``swirl clock'' effect from kinetic arguments and the medium’s Lorentz-like symmetry (Appendix~B). It unifies kinematic time dilation and gravitational redshift under one fluid phenomenon: both are due to local swirl energy content.
\item \textbf{Modified Faraday’s Law and Flux Quanta:} Perhaps the most distinctive prediction, we derived that a changing density of swirl strings induces an electric field curl, adding a term $G_{\circlearrowright}\partial_t\varrho_{\circlearrowright}$ to Faraday’s law (Eq.~\ref{eq:ModifiedFaraday}). The coupling $G_{\circlearrowright}$ is identified with $h/2e$, linking this new effect to the quantum of magnetic flux. A single vortex crossing a loop yields a sharp EMF impulse of one flux quantum. This result (derived in Appendix~D) points to experimental tests with SQUIDs and other systems.
\item \textbf{Topological Spectrum of Matter:} The allowed stable configurations of swirl strings correspond one-to-one with observed particle species (as summarized in Fig.~1). We highlighted how leptons, quarks, and photons map to specific knot types, and how composite knots model baryons and nuclei. Using a calibrated topological mass functional, SST can predict particle masses within a few percent in favorable cases, a level of quantitative prediction unusual for a beyond-standard-model theory.
    \item \textbf{Chirality-Dependent Dynamics:} SST attributes parity violation and certain time asymmetries to the handedness of the underlying vortices. We discussed how the theory accounts for attosecond-scale differences in photoionization times for opposite enantiomers (as observed in experiments~\cite{Han2025}) by invoking the concept of a swirl-clock orientation. Matter and antimatter are mirror-swirl states, which in SST have identical bulk properties except for how they interact with chiral environments or fields.
    \item \textbf{Unification and Realism:} With a single substrate and a unified set of equations, SST strives to unify interactions that in the Standard Model are disparate. The emergent $W_\mu^a$ gauge field in our Lagrangian hints at a common origin for gauge forces in coarse-grained vorticity structures. Moreover, SST is deterministic and realist at its core: the wavefunction’s mysteries are traded for concrete fluid behavior. While this is conceptually satisfying, it forces confronting issues like nonlocality and Bell's theorem in novel ways (e.g.\ through pre-existing topological linkages). We have not fully delved into those, but any future elaboration of SST must show how entanglement and spin-statistics arise naturally.
\end{itemize}

Looking forward, there are several avenues for further research and development of SST:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Relativistic and Strong-Field Extensions:} Thus far, SST recovers special relativistic kinematics and Newtonian gravity. The next step is to demonstrate (or refute) that SST can produce the full phenomenology of general relativity in appropriate regimes. This means exploring whether the fluid equations (perhaps with the $B_{\mu\nu}$ field) contain an analog of Einstein’s equations or at least the post-Newtonian corrections (light bending, gravitational time dilation, frame dragging, gravitational waves). The formal analogy between fluid flow equations and curved-space metrics (e.g.\ the Painlevé-Gullstrand form of Schwarzschild metric corresponds to a draining flow) should be investigated. A concrete goal would be to derive the effective spacetime metric seen by perturbations in the medium and check if it satisfies Einstein’s field equations with an emergent stress tensor. If discrepancies are found (for instance, if SST predicts the wrong amount of light bending), modifications to the theory or identification of specific experimental conditions under which it holds would be necessary.
    \item \textbf{Stability and Topology of Solutions:} We relied on qualitative arguments about knotted vortices. Rigorous work (likely numerical simulations) is needed to verify that a knotted vortex in an incompressible, inviscid fluid with the given additional terms can remain stable indefinitely. The inclusion of the helicity term $W\tilde{W}$ is presumably to stabilize knots against unraveling or shrinking. Simulations of vortex ring collisions, knot tying/unknotting in fluids, and their time dilation effects would provide tangible evidence for SST’s mechanisms. It would also help refine the particle-knot mapping: e.g.\ confirming that a trefoil loop carries one unit of charge and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ in the theory, whereas an unknot loop carries spin-1, etc.
    \item \textbf{Quantum Corrections and the Correspondence Limit:} While SST is a classical theory at heart, it must reproduce quantum mechanics as observed. That means demonstrating that small fluctuations (the phonon/torsion modes) on top of a background can be quantized in the usual way. One path is to quantize the effective field theory given by $\mathcal{L}$, treating $B_{\mu\nu}, W_\mu, \Phi$ fields quantum mechanically. This raises the possibility of new quanta: for example, quantized excitations of the $B$-field are like emergent photons (which we already consider), quantized $W$-field excitations might act like emergent gauge bosons (gluons, $W^\pm$, etc.), and quantized $\Phi$ excitations could be a new scalar (maybe related to the Higgs scale). SST might then incorporate a connection to the Higgs mechanism via $\Phi$ fluctuations (though $\Phi$ was not the SM Higgs, it could mix with it or explain electroweak symmetry breaking as a property of the medium’s anisotropy). Ensuring that this quantization leads to the correct commutation relations and uncertainty principles will either validate SST’s viability or reveal tension. The theory’s success will hinge on showing that no contradiction arises between having a fundamentally classical substrate and the observed irreducible quantum randomness---likely the randomness enters through sensitivity to initial conditions of the fluid (chaos amplifying microscopic fluctuations). This is reminiscent of Bohmian mechanics, but here the complexity of the fluid could lead to effectively unpredictable outcomes, matching the Born rule.
    \item \textbf{Integrating the Weak and Strong Interactions:} We have largely focused on gravity and electromagnetism. The outline of how weak and strong forces might emerge (via swirl gauge field $W_\mu^a$ and internal director fields $U_2, U_3$) has been hinted at but not fleshed out here. That is a major task: one must show that knotted vortices interacting in the fluid give rise to, say, $\mathrm{SU}(2)_L$ gauge fields that mediate beta decay, and an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ color interaction that confines the three quark-knots into a baryon. Possibly, the linking of three vortices (baryon) is stabilized by a shared topological flux analogous to a glued color flux tube---this might mirror the Y-shaped color flux tubes in QCD. The parity-violating term in $\mathcal{L}$ could be exploited to make one chirality of knot interact differently (thus replicating the chiral nature of the weak force). Achieving this in a controlled fluid model is challenging; it may require adding dissipative or symmetry-breaking terms that are phenomenological. If too much has to be added by hand, SST’s elegance would suffer. But if it naturally yields these interactions from, e.g., the coupling of vorticity to internal orientation fields, that would be a profound unification. One concrete step: derive the analog of the electroweak mixing angle or coupling constants from medium properties, and check if one can get values close to the observed $g, g'$, etc. At least qualitatively, an explanation of why the weak force is weak (massive $W,Z$ bosons) might come from twist stiffness or a cutoff length in the medium for certain excitations (the ``swirl Coulomb'' potential has a core $\rc$ which could correspond to a Compton wavelength of heavy bosons).
\item \textbf{Experimental Searches for Predicted Effects:} On the experimental side, the list of tests in Sec.~8 serves as a guide for near-term investigations. In particular, verifying the quantized EM impulse prediction would be a landmark result. Setting up the described SQUID experiment with a single vortex injection, or its superfluid analog, should be pursued. Additionally, experiments in high vacuum with atom interferometers could check for any unusual decoherence when subjected to rotating frame or in proximity to large-scale vortex flows (perhaps using superconducting magnets to simulate swirl fields). High-precision optical polarization experiments could attempt to detect any self-rotation or birefringence in vacuum aligned with the presence of swirling matter (for example, light passing near a rotating superfluid might experience a tiny phase shift if SST coupling exists). Although challenging, these experiments benefit from modern techniques in quantum sensing and could reach the sensitivity needed to detect extremely subtle effects.
    \item \textbf{Astrophysical and Cosmological Implications:} If the swirl medium is real, it might have consequences in astrophysics. For example, could astrophysical jets or vortex structures be manifestations of swirling vacuum? Or, could early-universe baryogenesis relate to an imbalance in swirl chirality (providing a tangible mechanism for matter--antimatter asymmetry by favoring one chirality of knots)? The ``triadic closure'' Axiom~0 which enforced something like a mod $2\pi$ sum for three circulations hints at a built-in baryon number conservation or asymmetry. It would be worthwhile to examine if SST can accommodate cosmic inflation or dark energy as properties of the medium (maybe $\Phi$ field variations or global rotation of the condensate). Similarly, dark matter might find an explanation as certain knot states that are stable but not interacting (like the figure-8 knot dark state we mentioned). One could predict, for instance, what fraction of medium excitations are in dark-sector knots given some conditions, and whether they could clump gravitationally---tying into structure formation.
\end{enumerate}

In closing, Swirl--String Theory offers a daring and grand unification of concepts, converting the metaphors of fluid dynamics into literal physical mechanisms for the universe’s workings. It brings the solidity of classical intuition to the ethereal realm of quantum fields and curved spacetime. Whether nature indeed operates like a cosmic superfluid remains to be seen. The theory does not shy from empirical risk: the coming years could see it triumph through confirmed predictions or face falsification. Regardless, the exploration of SST enriches the dialogue between disciplines---fluid mechanics, topology, quantum theory, and gravitation---illustrating how progress often re-emerges from reimagining old ideas (like Kelvin’s vortex) in the light of new knowledge. If nothing else, SST provides a fresh conceptual playground, one where one can picture the invisible: watching the fabric of reality swirl, knot, and unknot to craft the tapestry of particles and forces we observe.

\section*{Appendix A: Lagrangian Density and Master Equations}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix A: Lagrangian Density and Master Equations}

For completeness, we provide the full form of the SST Lagrangian density and some key field equations derived from it. As given in the main text (Eq.~\ref{eq:Lagrangian}), the Lagrangian can be written as:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\text{SST} =
    -\frac{\kappa_\omega}{4} W^{a}_{\mu\nu} W^{a,\mu\nu}
    + \frac{\kappa_B}{12} H_{\mu\nu\rho} H^{\mu\nu\rho}
    + \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \Phi)(\partial^\mu \Phi)
    - V(\Phi) \nonumber \\
    + \frac{\theta}{4} W^{a}_{\mu\nu} \tilde{W}^{a,\mu\nu}
    + \lambda_1 (u_\mu u^\mu + 1)
    + \lambda_2 (\nabla_\mu u^\mu) \nonumber \\
    + \sum_K \bar{\Psi}_K \left( i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m^{(\text{sol})}_K \right) \Psi_K
\label{eq:Lagrangian_full}
\end{align}

where the symbols have the meanings described earlier (briefly: $W^a_{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength of the swirl gauge field $W^a_\mu$, $H_{\mu\nu\rho} = \partial_{[\mu} B_{\nu\rho]}$ is the 3-form field strength of $B_{\mu\nu}$, $\Phi$ is the condensate modulus, $u_\mu$ is the unit timelike 4-velocity of the medium with Lagrange multipliers $\lambda_{1,2}$ enforcing its normalization and incompressibility, $\theta$ is the coefficient of the topological $W\tilde{W}$ term, and $\Psi_K$ are spinor fields representing quasiparticles for each knot type $K$ with soliton mass $m^{(\text{sol})}_K$).


From this $\mathcal{L}$, one can derive the Euler–Lagrange equations for each field. We list a few central equations (without damping or external forces, all in SI units or with $c=1$ in some cases):


\begin{itemize}

\item 
\emph{Condensate 4-velocity ($u^\mu$) equations:} Varying $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ yields the constraints
\begin{equation}
u_\mu u^\mu = -1, \qquad \nabla_\mu u^\mu = 0
\end{equation}
ensuring $u^\mu$ is a divergence-free unit vector field (effectively a statement of constant density and no expansion in the incompressible limit). Varying $u^\mu$ itself (taking into account these constraints and the coupling to other fields via $h_{\mu\nu}$) leads to a Navier–Stokes-like equation. In the simplest form (neglecting shear viscosity, pressure gradients beyond those coming from $\Phi$), it can be written as:
\begin{equation}
(u\cdot\nabla)u^\mu + \nabla^\mu \Phi_{\text{eff}} + \frac{1}{\rhoF} u_\nu H^{\nu\mu\sigma} u^\lambda H_{\lambda\sigma\alpha} u^\alpha = 0
\label{eq:Euler_equation}
\end{equation}
which is a generalized Euler equation for the flow. Here $\Phi_{\text{eff}}$ is an effective potential combining the pressure from fluid motion and any condensate potential $V(\Phi)$ contributions, and the last term represents the influence of vortex fields $H_{\mu\nu\rho}$ on the flow (it comes from the $H^2$ term and ensures Kelvin’s circulation theorem in the absence of other forces). Equation~\eqref{eq:Euler_equation} in a non-relativistic approximation reduces to $\partial_t \mathbf{v} + (\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{v} = -\nabla \tilde{h}$ (where $\tilde{h}$ is enthalpy per unit mass), consistent with classical incompressible flow equations.

\item 
\emph{Swirl 2-form ($B_{\mu\nu}$) field equation:} Varying $B_{\mu\nu}$ yields (using $H^{\mu\nu\rho} = \kappa_B^{-1} \partial \mathcal{L}/\partial (\partial_\rho B_{\mu\nu})$):
\begin{equation}
\partial_\rho H^{\mu\nu\rho} = J^{\mu\nu}
\label{eq:Beom}
\end{equation}

where $J^{\mu\nu}$ is the source 2-form from any coupling to $\Psi_K$ (if the knotted particles couple to $B$ as string sources). In the absence of explicit string sources (treating the fluid vorticity as mostly continuous), this is simply $\partial_\rho H^{\mu\nu\rho}=0$, which is analogous to vorticity conservation (Kelvin’s theorem in differential form). In 3-vector language, one part of this equation is $\partial_t \bm{\omega} = \nabla \times (\mathbf{v} \times \bm{\omega})$ (the vorticity transport equation for an inviscid fluid). This shows the medium supports vortex lines moving with the flow, and no vorticity is created or destroyed except where string sources (the $\Psi_K$ terms) might enter when a swirl string is explicitly introduced or ends (in our theory physical strings are closed loops so effectively $J^{\mu\nu}=0$ everywhere; an open string would need an end which doesn’t exist for a vortex in a true incompressible fluid).




\item 
\emph{Swirl gauge field ($W^a_\mu$) equations:} Varying $W^a_\mu$ and using $W^{a\mu\nu} = \partial \mathcal{L}/\partial (\partial_\nu W^a_\mu) = -\kappa_\omega W^{a\mu\nu} + \theta \tilde{W}^{a\mu\nu}$ yields a Yang--Mills type equation with a topological current:

\begin{equation}
D_\nu W^{a,\mu\nu} + \frac{\theta}{2\kappa_\omega} \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} W^a_{\nu\rho} \partial_\sigma (\cdot) = J^{a,\mu}
\label{eq:Weom}
\end{equation}

where $D_\nu$ is the covariant derivative for the gauge group and $J^{a,\mu}$ is the Noether current from $\Psi_K$ spinors (e.g., $\bar{\Psi}\gamma^\mu T^a \Psi$). The second term (with $\theta$) is identically zero when taking divergence (Bianchi identity), but its variation yields the conserved helicity charge. If $\theta \neq 0$, the theory admits solutions with nonzero $W\tilde{W}$ that saturate certain bounds (resembling instantons; in our context they reflect knottedness conservation). Ignoring $\theta$ for the equation of motion, Eq.~\eqref{eq:Weom} reduces to $D_\nu W^{a,\mu\nu} = J^{a,\mu}$, a standard Yang--Mills equation stating that coarse-grained swirl vorticity ($W_{\mu\nu}$) is sourced by knotted spinor currents. In the Abelian case (analogue of Maxwell), this splits into a Coulomb-like law and Faraday's law. For example, setting $a$ to correspond to electromagnetism and ignoring non-Abelian parts, the spatial components yield $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho_{\text{el}} + \rho_{\circlearrowright}$, where we have included both electric charge density $\rho_{\text{el}}$ from conventional charges and an effective contribution $\rho_{\circlearrowright}$ from the time-varying swirl density via $G_{\circlearrowright}$ coupling (this comes from the modified Gauss's law including the new induction term). Likewise, the curl of the electric field gives Eq.~\ref{eq:ModifiedFaraday} in the main text.

In short, Eq.~\eqref{eq:Weom} contains within it the modified Maxwell equations:

\begin{align*}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &= \frac{\rho_e}{\varepsilon_0} + G_{\circlearrowright} \varrho_{\circlearrowright} \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} - \frac{1}{c^2} \partial_t \mathbf{E} &= \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_e + G_{\circlearrowright} \nabla \times \mathbf{M}_{\circlearrowright} \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0 \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} + \partial_t \mathbf{B} &= G_{\circlearrowright} \partial_t \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\circlearrowright}
\end{align*}

where $\rho_e$, $\mathbf{J}_e$ are electric charge and current of conventional sources, and $\varrho_{\circlearrowright}$, $\mathbf{M}_{\circlearrowright}$, $\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\circlearrowright}$ represent effective sources due to the swirl medium (with $G_{\circlearrowright}$ playing the role of coupling constant). In static conditions without vortices, these reduce to the usual Maxwell equations.

\item 
\emph{Condensate modulus ($\Phi$) equation:} Varying $\Phi$ yields a Klein--Gordon-type equation for the condensate stiffness:

\begin{equation}
\nabla^\mu \nabla_\mu \Phi + \frac{\partial V}{\partial \Phi} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial \ln(\rhoF)}{\partial \Phi} H_{\mu\nu\rho} H^{\mu\nu\rho} + \ldots
\label{eq:PhiEq}
\end{equation}

The right-hand side could include contributions from how $\rhoF$ (the effective density) might depend on $\Phi$. In many formulations, one would assume $\rhoF$ is constant and then the equation is simply $\nabla^2 \Phi - V'(\Phi)=0$, which has the homogeneous solution $\Phi=\Phi_0$ as a stable vacuum. Small excitations $\delta \Phi$ would propagate with velocity determined by $V''(\Phi_0)$, potentially representing a massive scalar mode (which could be very high mass if the medium is very stiff, hence not easily excited except perhaps in extreme events like the Big Bang or neutron stars).




\item 
\emph{Soliton spinor ($\Psi_K$) equations:} Each quasiparticle field satisfies a Dirac equation minimally coupled to $W_\mu$:
\begin{equation}
i\gamma^\mu D_\mu \Psi_K - m^{(\text{sol})}_K \Psi_K = 0
\label{eq:DiracEq}
\end{equation}
Here $D_\mu = \partial_\mu + i g_{\text{sw}} W_\mu^a T^a$ as before. This equation is an effective one emerging after one has integrated out the detailed vortex structure, so $m^{(\text{sol})}_K$ already encodes the energy of the knotted vortex. Importantly, any solution $\Psi_K$ must be supported by an underlying vortex configuration in the $B$ and $W$ fields. In practice, one might solve the classical equations for a knotted vortex (neglecting $\Psi$), then quantize small fluctuations around it to produce $\Psi$ as a collective coordinate. The Dirac equation ensures these spinor solutions transform correctly under Lorentz symmetry and have the right statistics (assuming the usual anticommutation for spinor fields).

What is notable is that in the limit of a weakly coupled gauge field ($g_{\text{sw}}\to 0$ or medium very symmetric), Eq.~\ref{eq:DiracEq} decouples and the spinor is free, revealing the physical interpretation: a free $\Psi_K$ corresponds to a free knotted vortex propagating without interacting beyond carrying its rest mass.

\end{itemize}

This Appendix has laid out the formal underpinnings of SST’s equations. While complex, they show consistency with known forms: Kelvin’s circulation theorem, Navier–Stokes continuity, Yang–Mills equations, etc., are all embedded here. Many simplifying assumptions were used (inviscid fluid, symmetrical condensate, etc.); relaxing those will enrich the phenomenology (e.g.\ small viscosity could correspond to finite lifetimes of certain states or CPT violation due to small helicity-violation $\chi_h$).

Finally, to connect with Table~III in the main text (traceability of concepts), we mention some “Master” dimensionless parameters that appear in these equations and calibrations:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Fr} = \frac{v^2}{gL}, \quad
\mathrm{Re} = \frac{\rhoF vL}{\eta}, \quad
\frac{\rhoM}{\rhoF} = \frac{v^2}{c^2}, \quad
G_{\text{swirl}} = \frac{\kappa^2 \rhoF}{8\pi^2 c^2}\label{eq:MasterParams}
\end{equation}

where $\mathrm{Fr}$ is a Froude number (ratio of flow inertia to gravity, relevant in analog gravity contexts), $\mathrm{Re}$ is Reynolds number (which in our idealized theory is infinite due to $\eta=0$ viscosity), $\rhoM/\rhoF$ ratio relates swirl energy to rest energy density, and $G_{\text{swirl}}$ is an example of how medium constants determine gravitational coupling. Plugging numbers (as done in the main text’s Table~III): if $\rhoF \sim 10^{-7}$ kg/m$^3$, $\kappa$ corresponds to $h/m_{\mathrm{eff}}$ with $m_{\mathrm{eff}}$ chosen around some Planck-scale or particle-scale value, one can indeed get $G_{\text{swirl}} \approx 6.67\times10^{-11}$ SI. Thus, the abstract equations here can meet empirical scales.


\section*{Appendix B: Derivation of Swirl-Clock Time Dilation}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix B: Derivation of Swirl-Clock Time Dilation}

In this appendix, we derive Eq.~\eqref{eq:SwirlTimeDilation} of the main text from the dynamics of the swirl medium. The result, $dt_{\text{local}} = \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}\, dt_{\infty}$, can be obtained in multiple ways: (1) by analyzing the metric induced by moving with the fluid’s 4-velocity $u^\mu$, (2) by using an energy argument (equating kinetic and total energy for a comoving clock), or (3) by analogy to special relativity with the existence of a preferred frame. We provide method (1) here, which is geometric and aligns with modern Lorentz ether interpretations.

Consider an observer (clock) attached to a small swirl string segment moving with velocity $v$ relative to the rest frame of the medium. In the rest frame of the medium (the “lab frame” or chronos frame), the metric is just flat Minkowski: $ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + d\mathbf{x}^2$. The fluid provides a preferred slicing of spacetime into absolute time $T(x^\mu)$ surfaces (i.e.\ $T= \text{constant}$ defines a simultaneity in the medium’s rest frame). The clock moves with 4-velocity $U^\mu_{\text{clock}}$. Because the clock is comoving with the local fluid, $U^\mu_{\text{clock}}$ is aligned with the fluid’s $u^\mu$ at that location (except perhaps small residual motions if not exactly stuck to a vortex line; here we assume it’s attached to the vortex).

Therefore, $U^\mu_{\text{clock}} = u^\mu$ (clock moves with the fluid element), which implies
\begin{equation}
U^0_{\text{clock}} = \gamma, \qquad U^i_{\text{clock}} = \gamma \beta^i,
\end{equation}
where $\beta^i = v^i/c$ and $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$, in the coordinates of the lab frame. This is just a statement that if the fluid element moves at velocity $\mathbf{v}$, then the time-component of its 4-velocity is $\gamma$.

Now the proper time increment $d\tau$ measured by the clock between two events (e.g.\ ticks) on its worldline is given by the metric:
\begin{equation}
d\tau^2 = -\frac{ds^2}{c^2} = dt^2 - \frac{d\mathbf{x}^2}{c^2},
\end{equation}
for those events (assuming they are closely separated). If in time $dt$ the clock moves $d\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{v} dt$, then
\begin{equation*}
d\tau^2 = dt^2 \left(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}\right),
\end{equation*}
so $d\tau = \sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\, dt$. By identification, $dt_{\text{local}} = d\tau$ (proper time of clock) and $dt_{\infty} = dt$ (lab frame time, essentially the time coordinate $T$ at infinity far from any swirl), yielding
\begin{equation}
dt_{\text{local}} = \sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\, dt_{\infty}.
\end{equation}
This matches Eq.~\eqref{eq:SwirlTimeDilation}.

The interpretation is straightforward: the swirl medium’s rest frame is the frame of “aether” time $t_{\infty}$ (which we called chronos time). A clock moving at speed $v$ relative to this frame will be slowed by the usual Lorentz factor. What ensures consistency in SST (so that this is not in conflict with all relativity experiments) is that all physical processes including light propagation are also governed by the same metric and thus also experience the same time dilation and length contraction. For instance, light still moves at speed $c$ in the medium (by construction of $\rhoF$ as analogous to $\varepsilon_0$), and the laws of physics in a moving frame of the medium take the Lorentz-transformed form. This is essentially the Lorentz invariance of the equations built into our Lagrangian, albeit with a hidden absolute frame.

To connect this derivation to a more fluid-mechanical perspective: one can derive time dilation from Bernoulli’s principle. In steady flow (no explicit time dependence in lab frame), the quantity $E = \frac{1}{2}v^2 + w + \Phi_g$ is constant along flow lines (where $w$ is specific enthalpy and $\Phi_g$ gravitational potential). In our case, $w$ might include rest energy $c^2$ as well since we consider relativistic regime. If a fluid element’s total energy is constant, then if kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}v^2$ increases, the internal energy (which influences clock rate) must decrease. A rough argument is that a clock’s tick rate is proportional to its internal energy transitions (say an atomic transition frequency). If that internal energy is effectively lower by a factor $\gamma$ when moving (time dilation corresponds to lower frequency), then indeed $\nu_{\text{moving}} = \nu_{\text{rest}}/\gamma$. This is an informal reasoning consistent with the exact result we derived above.

Another approach uses the so-called “chronometric invariants” formalism (used by Lorentz ether theories \cite{Barcelo2011}): define a global time $t$ and a spatial metric $h_{ij}$ on simultaneity surfaces. The proper time for an observer with velocity $v^i$ relative to the ether is $d\tau = \sqrt{-g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu}/c = \sqrt{dt^2 - h_{ij}dx^i dx^j/c^2}$. If $h_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$ (flat space) and $dx^i = v^i dt$, it reduces to the above. In curved or flow-distorted cases, one might get additional gravitational redshift factors (e.g.\ if $\Phi_g$ present, $d\tau = \sqrt{(1+2\Phi_g/c^2) - v^2/c^2}\, dt$ to first order). SST indeed predicts gravitational potential affects time similarly, since $\Phi_g$ arises from swirl flows as well.

In conclusion, the swirl-clock time dilation factor is a built-in feature of any Lorentz-covariant theory with a preferred frame and consistent dynamics. SST passes this test by construction. Notably, if one were to detect a deviation from $S_t = \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ at high $v$ for moving clocks, that would falsify Lorentz invariance. Experiments (particle lifetime measurements, fast ion clocks) confirm the $\gamma$ factor to high precision, thus also confirming that if a fluid ether exists, it must exactly implement this time dilation. Our derivation shows how SST does so: by encoding motion effects in the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ and ensuring all matter fields ($\Psi_K$, etc.) couple to that metric in the standard way (through the minimal coupling and $h_{\mu\nu}$ projector).


\section*{Appendix C: Emergent Newtonian Gravity from Swirl Pressure}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix C: Emergent Newtonian Gravity from Swirl Pressure}

Here we derive the inverse-square law attraction between two swirl strings, focusing on the “Hydrogen-Gravity mechanism” described in Sec.~4. We work in the regime of non-relativistic flow ($v \ll c$, incompressible fluid) and show how a pair of vortex loops co-axial along an axis produce a force analogous to Newtonian gravity.


\subsection*{C1. Pressure field of a single vortex loop}

Consider an isolated swirl string that, for simplicity, we treat as a thin straight vortex filament of circulation $\kappa$ aligned with the $z$-axis (an infinite line, which can approximate a large loop section or a vortex through a torus representing a bound hydrogen-like system). In cylindrical coordinates $(r,\varphi,z)$, the flow is azimuthal: $\mathbf{v}(r) = v_\varphi(r), \hat{\varphi}$, with

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vat}
v_\varphi(r) = \frac{\kappa}{2\pi,r} f(r),
\end{equation}

where $f(r)$ is some profile function that accounts for the vortex core (e.g. $f(r)=0$ inside core of radius $a$, tend to 1 at $r \gg a$). For an ideal thin vortex, $f(r)=1$ for $r>a$ and effectively $v$ diverges as $1/r$ outside core, then drops to 0 at $r=0$ (physical core size provides cutoff).


Under these conditions, the fluid’s Bernoulli equation (from momentum conservation) in steady state reads:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} v^2 + \frac{p}{\rhoF} = \text{const (along a streamline)}.
\end{equation}

Far from the vortex ($r\to \infty$), we can set $p \to p_{\infty}$ (ambient pressure) and $v \to 0$, so the constant is $p_{\infty}/\rhoF$. Thus at radius $r$,

\begin{equation}
\frac{p(r) - p_{\infty}}{\rhoF} = -\frac{1}{2} v_\varphi(r)^2,.
\label{eq:BernPressure}
\end{equation}

Plugging Eq.~\eqref{eq:vat} for $v_\varphi$ (and assuming $r$ outside the core so $f(r)\approx 1$), we obtain

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pressuredrop}
\Delta p(r) \equiv p(r) - p_{\infty} = -\frac{\rhoF \kappa^2}{8\pi^2 r^2},.
\end{equation}

This is the pressure deficit as a function of radius. It falls off as $1/r^2$. Note that this is structurally similar to a Coulomb or gravitational potential profile (since in a static field, $\nabla^2 \Phi \propto \delta(\mathbf{r})$ leads to $\Phi \propto 1/r$ in 3D, and field $\propto 1/r^2$). Indeed, one can define an effective potential for this vortex:

\begin{equation}
    \Phi_{\text{swirl}}(r) = \int^r \frac{\Delta p(r')}{\rhoF}, dr' = -\frac{\kappa^2}{8\pi^2 r},,
\end{equation}

where we integrated assuming core cutoff at small $r$. The form $-A/r$ emerges, with $A = \kappa^2/(8\pi^2)$.


This $\Phi_{\text{swirl}}(r)$ plays the role of a gravitational potential in SST. In particular, one can identify $A$ with $G M$ for some mass $M$. If one considers the energy of the vortex per unit length as $\rhoM c^2$ times volume, one can find an effective mass distribution. But a simpler route is to go directly to force.


\subsection*{C2. Force between two coaxial vortices}

Now take two identical vortex filaments (circulation $\kappa$ each) aligned on the $z$-axis, separated by a distance $Z$ along $z$. We imagine them as representing two distant swirling objects (like two hydrogen atoms on an axis, each with a vortex line through it). The question is: what is the force between them?


In fluid statics, two parallel vortex lines with the same circulation sign actually rotate around each other (like a vortex pair), and two vortex rings on an axis either move apart or together depending on flow direction. But if they are steady and coaxial, one can calculate an interaction energy or pressure field superposition.


Since the flow is irrotational outside the cores except on the axis (no other vorticity introduced), we can approximate the pressure field as a superposition of each vortex’s field:


\[
p_{\text{total}}(r,z) \approx p_{\infty} - \frac{\rhoF \kappa^2}{8\pi^2} \left( \frac{1}{r^2 + (z - Z/2)^2} + \frac{1}{r^2 + (z + Z/2)^2} \right) / 2
\]


The net force on one vortex due to the presence of the other can be found by integrating the pressure over its core cross-section area facing the other vortex. Equivalently, one can derive it from the gradient of an interaction energy.


By symmetry, the force will be along $\pm z$ axis. The pressure on the end of one vortex (facing the other) is lower than on the far side, causing it to be pulled. The difference in pressure $\Delta p$ across a cross-section roughly of area $A$ yields force $F = \Delta p , A$.


Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:pressuredrop}, the pressure due to vortex 2 at the location of vortex 1 (on-axis) is:


\[
\Delta p_{2\to1} = -\frac{\rhoF \kappa^2}{8\pi^2 Z^2}
\]


Multiplying by the cross-sectional area of the vortex core $A \sim \pi a^2$ (where $a$ is core radius) gives the force magnitude:

\begin{equation}
F \approx \frac{\rhoF \kappa^2 a^2}{8\pi Z^2}
\label{eq:forceest}
\end{equation}

Now, $\rhoF \kappa^2 a^2/(8\pi)$ can be interpreted. If we identify $\mu = \rhoF \pi a^2$ as the “mass per unit length” of the vortex core (since $\rhoM = \rhoF v^2/2c^2$ and $v^2$ at core relates to $\kappa/a$, but let’s assume non-relativistic so mass per length $\approx$ energy per length$/c^2$ = $\rhoF v^2/2c^2 \cdot$ area?), it gets tricky to interpret directly. But qualitatively, $F \propto 1/Z^2$.


Comparing to Newton’s law $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{Z^2}$, we can read off an effective gravitational constant times masses. We expect $m_1 \sim m_2 \sim$ (mass of vortex represented hydrogen atom). The derivation here is crude, but one can refine by considering the momentum flux in the fluid and using the vortex self-energy as surrogate for mass. A more rigorous approach is to compute the interaction energy via fluid kinetic energy:


\[
E_{\text{int}} = \frac{1}{2}\rhoF \int (\mathbf{v}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_2)\, dV
\]


To put it succinctly: the potential energy of two aligned vortices is


\[
U(Z) \propto -\frac{\rhoF \kappa^2 \ell}{8\pi^2}\frac{1}{Z}
\]


\[
F = -\frac{dU}{dZ} \propto -\frac{\rhoF \kappa^2 \ell}{8\pi^2}\frac{1}{Z^2}
\]


By identifying $\frac{\rhoF \kappa^2 \ell}{8\pi^2} = G M_1 M_2$, we can define the masses:


\[
M = \frac{\rhoF \kappa^2 \ell}{8\pi^2 G}
\]


Thus, the emergent gravity constant in SST is:

\begin{equation}
G_{\text{swirl}} = \frac{\rhoF \kappa^2}{8\pi^2}
\label{eq:Gswirl}
\end{equation}

as quoted earlier in Appendix~A in different notation. Achieving $G_{\text{swirl}}=G_N$ is one calibration condition of the theory.


In summary, two swirling objects attract with $F \approx G_{\text{swirl}} \frac{M_1 M_2}{Z^2}$, thereby reproducing Newton’s law in the appropriate regime. The “mass” here corresponds to fluid-dynamical mass (energy of swirl tied up in the object divided by $c^2$). Non-chiral swirl distributions (like opposite circulations bound together) yield little far-field $1/r$ effect and thus behave as having less active gravitational mass—this addresses why symmetric configurations might be gravitationally inert (or nearly so, akin to how two opposite vortices side by side produce near-cancellation of far field).


One must note limitations: our derivation assumed incompressibility and ignored relativistic corrections. If flows approach $c$, or if pressures become too large, modifications would occur (potentially connecting to GR deviations). However, for typical subsonic internal flows (e.g. electrons swirling at $v \sim c\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is fine structure constant, that’s $\sim 0.007c$—non-relativistic), these formulas hold.


\[
V_{\text{SST}}(r) = -\Lambda/\sqrt{r^2 + \rc^2}
\]

We have thus shown how Newtonian gravitational attraction emerges from fluid pressure deficits around swirl strings, making concrete the heuristic arguments of Sec.~4.


\section*{Appendix D: Electromotive Impulse from Swirl Density Change}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix D: Electromotive Impulse from Swirl Density Change}

This appendix provides a derivation for the modified Faraday’s law and the resulting quantized EMF impulse that occurs when the linking number between a swirl string and an electrical loop changes by one.

\subsection*{D1. Integral form derivation of modified Faraday law}

We begin with Faraday’s law in integral form for a loop $C$ bounding a surface $S$:
\begin{equation}
\oint_{C} \mathbf{E}\cdot d\bm{\ell} = -\frac{d}{dt}\int_{S} \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A}
\label{eq:FaradayIntegral}
\end{equation}

Now imagine that through the surface $S$, in addition to magnetic flux, there are $\mathcal{N}(t)$ swirl strings passing (each string here meaning a vortex line carrying quantized circulation $\kappa$). These swirl strings are not electromagnetic in themselves, but SST posits that a time-varying $\mathcal{N}$ will induce an $\mathbf{E}$-field circulation.

We hypothesize a modified law:
\begin{equation}
\oint_C \mathbf{E}\cdot d\bm{\ell} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} - \frac{d\Phi_{\circlearrowright}}{dt}
\label{eq:FaradayModHyp}
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_B = \int_S \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$ is the ordinary magnetic flux, and $\Phi_{\circlearrowright}$ is a new term proportional to the number of swirl strings linking $C$. Specifically, since each swirl string is associated with a circulation quantum $\kappa$ and coupling constant $G_{\circlearrowright}$, the dimensional analysis and consistency with Maxwell’s equations require $\Phi_{\circlearrowright} = -G_{\circlearrowright} \mathcal{N}(t)$ (the minus sign just to follow Lenz’s law sign conventions conveniently).

To determine $G_{\circlearrowright}$, consider a single event: one swirl string appears through $S$ (so $\Delta \mathcal{N} = +1$) over a short time $\Delta t$. Then Eq.~\eqref{eq:FaradayModHyp} would predict a sudden jump in the left side (EMF) equal to $-\Delta \Phi_{\circlearrowright}/\Delta t = G_{\circlearrowright} (\Delta \mathcal{N}/\Delta t)$. Taking $\Delta t$ short, effectively an impulse $\mathcal{E} = \int \mathbf{E}\cdot d\bm{\ell} \, dt = G_{\circlearrowright} \Delta \mathcal{N}$. For one vortex ($\Delta \mathcal{N}=1$), $\mathcal{E} = G_{\circlearrowright}$. This $\mathcal{E}$ has units of Weber (since $\mathbf{E}\cdot d\bm{\ell} \, dt$ integrates to magnetic flux unit). Empirically, if such an impulse is observed and equals one flux quantum $\Phi_0 = h/2e$, we can equate:
\begin{equation}
G_{\circlearrowright} = \Phi_0 = \frac{h}{2e}
\label{eq:GcircleValue}
\end{equation}

This was an assumption in our main text that the coupling is identified with the known quantum of flux. If one did not know $\Phi_0$ from superconductivity, one could attempt to derive $G_{\circlearrowright}$ from consistency in dimensions or perhaps from a quantum argument: a change of one vortex linking corresponds to a phase change of $2\pi$ in a superconducting wavefunction around the loop, which by flux quantization implies the EMF must equal $h/2e$. In any case, taking $G_{\circlearrowright}=h/2e$ allows us to rewrite the modified Faraday law compactly as:
\begin{equation}
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} + \frac{h}{2e} \frac{\partial \varrho_{\circlearrowright}}{\partial t} \hat{\mathbf{n}}
\end{equation}
where $\varrho_{\circlearrowright}$ is the areal density of swirl strings (so $\int_S \partial_t \varrho_{\circlearrowright} \, dA = \partial_t \mathcal{N}$) and $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is oriented by right-hand rule to link orientation (thus giving direction to the induced field consistent with orientation conventions).

\subsection*{D2. Electromotive impulse calculation}

We now consider the scenario in detail: A single vortex loop initially wholly outside loop $C$ enters and passes through $C$, linking it once, then perhaps annihilates or leaves. During this process, what is the induced voltage $V(t)$ in a physical coil following $C$?

From Eq.~\eqref{eq:FaradayModHyp},
\begin{equation}
\oint_C \mathbf{E}\cdot d\bm{\ell} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} + \frac{h}{2e} \frac{d\mathcal{N}}{dt}
\end{equation}

If no change in ordinary magnetic flux $\Phi_B$ happens (assume the vortex has no actual magnetic field tied to it; it might carry some effective vector potential coupling but no real magnetic flux in vacuum scenario), then
\begin{equation}
\oint_C \mathbf{E}\cdot d\bm{\ell} = \frac{h}{2e} \frac{d\mathcal{N}}{dt}
\end{equation}

Integrate both sides over the entire event time (from before vortex entry to after vortex exit):
\begin{equation}
\int_{t_i}^{t_f} \oint_C \mathbf{E}\cdot d\bm{\ell} \, dt = \frac{h}{2e} \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \frac{d\mathcal{N}}{dt} dt
\end{equation}

The right side is $\frac{h}{2e} (\mathcal{N}(t_f) - \mathcal{N}(t_i))$. If initially no vortex and finally one vortex passed (or vice versa if it annihilates), $\Delta \mathcal{N} = \pm 1$. So the integral is $\pm h/2e$. The left side is the net flux change through the coil, which equals $\int V(t) \, dt$ (the time-integral of induced voltage around the loop). Thus:
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} V(t) \, dt = \pm \frac{h}{2e}
\label{eq:voltageImpulse}
\end{equation}

This means the total time-integrated voltage (the area under the voltage vs. time curve, or equivalently the step change in flux linkage through the coil) is one flux quantum. The sign depends on whether a vortex enters ($+$) or leaves ($-$) and on relative orientation (Lenz’s law sign — an entering vortex will induce a polarity that opposes it in a certain orientation etc.). This is a crisp, binary prediction: one vortex event, one flux quantum impulse.

If multiple vortices passed in sequence, the impulses add, giving multiples of $\Phi_0$. If a vortex-antivortex pair nucleates and one goes through while the other goes the opposite side, one might get opposite sign impulses cancel if both link the loop, or separate signals if only one links, etc. The possibilities align with the idea that only linking number changes matter, not other details.

Notably, this result is independent of the coil’s shape or resistance; even if it’s not a superconductor, an EMF is induced and if open-circuited, it results in a certain integrated voltage. In a closed circuit, it would drive a current such that the flux quantum mostly ends up counteracted by induced current (in a superconductor, it would persist as current).

We can examine the consistency with energy conservation. A vortex moving through a loop generates an EMF which could do work on the circuit (like lighting a lamp briefly). Where does that energy come from? In SST, it comes from the kinetic energy of the vortex or medium. Essentially, as the vortex passes the loop, it experiences a drag from Lenz’s law: the induced current’s magnetic field exerts a force on the vortex, slowing it (or requiring work to push it through). This is analogous to how moving a magnet into a coil transfers energy from your work into electrical energy. In SST, the coupling $G_{\circlearrowright}$ is set so that one quantum of circulation yields exactly one quantum of flux, so the work done per event is $(\text{current}) \times (\text{flux quantum})$ and so on, matching known quantum relations.


\subsection*{D3. Gauge field derivation}

We can also derive the modified Faraday law via the $W_\mu$ gauge field formalism. The presence of a swirl string is akin to a quantized pseudomagnetic flux tube for the $W$ field. In Maxwell’s equations with sources, a changing ``magnetic'' flux (here pseudomagnetic from swirl) yields an $\mathbf{E}$. In fact, in the $W$ field Bianchi identity:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{[\sigma}(\nabla \times \mathbf{E})_{\mu\nu]} = \partial_{[\sigma}(\partial_\mu B_{\nu]} + G_{\circlearrowright} \partial_\mu \tilde{W}_{\nu]}) = 0
\end{equation}

one sees $\partial_t (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) = -\nabla \times \partial_t \mathbf{B} + G_{\circlearrowright} \partial_t \nabla \times \tilde{\mathbf{W}}$. But $\nabla \times \tilde{\mathbf{W}}$ corresponds to swirl string areal density in that representation. Working through yields the same term.

In conclusion, the swirl--EM induction effect is a direct consequence of including the topological coupling between $B$-field (fluid vortex field) and the electromagnetic $A$-field (vector potential). One could show that an added term $L_{\text{int}} \sim G_{\circlearrowright} B_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ in the Lagrangian, when varied, produces the modified Faraday equation. However, such a term might break gauge invariance unless $B_{\mu\nu}$ is a curl of some potential (which it is). A safer way is to incorporate it via the $W$ fields and the induction term $b_{\circlearrowright} = G_{\circlearrowright}\partial_t \varrho_{\circlearrowright}$ (like in Table~III).

The upshot: whenever the topology of the swirl configuration changes (a linking number through a loop), an electromotive response of fixed magnitude results. This is a clear, falsifiable prediction that sets SST apart from conventional EM (which would predict no such effect without actual magnetic fields or charges present).

If an experiment sees, for example, a flux quantum entering a SQUID absent any applied magnetic flux but coincident with an engineered vortex event, this would strongly support SST’s concept. On the other hand, stringent null results would constrain $G_{\circlearrowright}$ to be much smaller than $h/2e$, perhaps forcing it effectively to zero, which would push SST into a corner or exclude it. The experiment’s feasibility and current status are beyond this appendix, but as noted, analogous effects in superconductors already inform us that if the vacuum acts similarly, $\Phi_0$ is the relevant scale.

This completes our derivation of the modified Faraday law and the quantized impulse phenomenon.
