  "description": "I present a self-contained treatment of electron--swirl transport within . The analysis (i) derives a  solution to the coupled density-matrix equations in 1D, (ii) makes  predictions for tabletop experiments with explicit materials, geometries, and signal levels, and (iii) states clear . The framework reproduces the Peierls (population) and Allen--Feldman (coherence) limits  while embedding electrons as  (knotted vortex filaments) coupled to swirl modes. Kinematic time-rate variations locally modulate the electronic Hamiltonian through the  factor . The swirl clock \\( } \\) corresponds to a scalar time-foliation field (khronon) whose gradient defines the local time direction, analogous to the preferred foliation in Einstein–Æther and Hořava–Lifshitz gravity .\n        Numerical scales are anchored by SST canonical values \\[, \\], and . For compactness, some intermediate results are given in units of the SST frequency ",
