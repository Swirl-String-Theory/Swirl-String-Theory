  "description": "We investigate whether structured electromagnetic near fields with dominant\n        toroidal multipole moments can induce measurable modifications of the quantum\n        vacuum stress--energy tensor. In quantum electrodynamics (QED), vacuum\n        polarization introduces nonlinear corrections to Maxwell electrodynamics\n        described by the Euler--Heisenberg effective Lagrangian. We show that\n        counter-rotating, phase-locked toroidal current configurations (anapole states)\n        maximize these nonlinear field invariants while suppressing radiative losses,\n        thereby concentrating stress in the electromagnetic near field. Interpreted\n        within the polarizable-vacuum representation of gravity, such localized vacuum\n        polarization corresponds to an effective refractive-index gradient and hence to\n        a weak emergent metric perturbation. The predicted effects are extremely small\n        and do not constitute macroscopic gravity control. Instead, the proposal defines\n        a falsifiable laboratory framework for probing the coupling between topological\n        electrodynamics, vacuum stress--energy, and analog gravitational metrics.",
