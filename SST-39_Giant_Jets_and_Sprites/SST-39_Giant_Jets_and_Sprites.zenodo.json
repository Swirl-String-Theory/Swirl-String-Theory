  "description": "<div>\n<pre>This paper examines the energetics of transient luminous events (sprites and giant jets) through a systematic mapping from special relativity (SR) to the Vortex &AElig;ther Model (VAM) and then to the canonical Swirl--String Theory (SST). <br>We show that the SR rest--kinetic decomposition re-emerges in VAM with \\( c -&gt; v_\\circlearrowleft \\), and that the same structure has a natural translation into SST via the Swirl Clock formalism. <br>The goal is to provide a coherent physical and mathematical account of excitation (giant jets) and relaxation (sprites) as macroscopic analogues of quantum transitions.</pre>\n</div>",
