  "description": "We study magnetic helicity in periodic domains, addressing gauge conditions, existence of vector potentials, and periodic winding. The analysis covers bounded boxes with periodic identifications and fully periodic 3-torus domains, establishing conditions for gauge invariance and topological obstructions to periodic vector potentials.",
