  "description": "Neutrinos appear exclusively left-handed in low-energy interactions. In the Standard Model this is imposed by construction through the \\(SU(2)_L\\) chiral gauge structure. In this paper we derive an alternative, purely geometric origin for neutrino chirality based on the swirl–clock structure of Swirl–String Theory (SST). A universal timelike field \\(u^}^{\\), which itself arises from harmonic motion at the Compton frequency over the classical radius. Integrating out the right-chiral neutrino generates a low-energy effective theory with a single propagating chiral state—recovering the observed left-handed neutrino sector. Hydrogen's 3",
