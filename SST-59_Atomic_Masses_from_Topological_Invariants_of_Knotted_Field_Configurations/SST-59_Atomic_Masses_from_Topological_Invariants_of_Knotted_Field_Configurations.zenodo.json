  "description": "We present a classical, topology-driven mass formula for elementary particles,\n        atomic nuclei, and molecules.\n        The theory is implemented numerically in a companion reference code and is\n        derived here in a form exactly isomorphic to that implementation.\n        Mass emerges as a geometric invariant associated with knotted field\n        configurations, independent of quantum postulates or Higgs couplings.\n        The theory depends only on geometric and topological quantities: a kernel\n        suppression index, genus, component number, and dimensionless ropelength.",
