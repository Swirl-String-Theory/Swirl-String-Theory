  "description": " in the medium induces an electromotive response. In particular, we derive a modified Faraday's law in which changes in swirl string areal density act as a source of electric field (via a coupling constant $, including the canonical derivation of the coupling constant $$ (a flux quantum). We outline how condensed-matter systems (e.g. type-II superconductors, Bose–Einstein condensates, or magnetic defect films) can be used to simulate such topological transitions and detect the predicted quantized impulses. The conceptual novelty of this approach is highlighted, and we discuss how measuring these signals would provide empirical evidence for the SST framework or, conversely, place strong constraints on it. Technical derivations of the modified Faraday law, the vortex nucleation threshold, and impulse quantization are provided in the Appendices to maintain continuity in the main text.",
