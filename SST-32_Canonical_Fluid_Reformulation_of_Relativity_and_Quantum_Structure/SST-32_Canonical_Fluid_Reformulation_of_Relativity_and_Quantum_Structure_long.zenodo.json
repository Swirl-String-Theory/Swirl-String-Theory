  "description": "We present (SST), a fluid-topological framework that reinterprets relativity and quantum phenomena via a single incompressible medium. In SST, matter and radiation are modeled as quantized vortex loops () in a universal, non-dissipative condensate. The theory posits that classical gravity emerges as a collective pressure effect of these vortices rather than fundamental spacetime curvature, and that local induce time dilation analogous to relativistic kinematics. We develop the formal field-theoretic Lagrangian for this medium, showing how a preferred foliation and topological quantization yield a discrete particle spectrum: quantum numbers (mass, charge, spin) correspond to topological invariants of knot-like vortex excitations. A modified Faraday's law is derived, unifying electromagnetic induction with rotating-frame effects by predicting that time-varying swirl string density generates an electromotive force. We also describe how SST accounts for wave--particle duality through dual phase (un-knotted vs. knotted) states of vortex loops, with quantum measurement corresponding to topological transitions. Several experimental tests are proposed to falsify or support SST, including quantized electromagnetic impulses from vortex reconnection events, attosecond-scale chirality-dependent time delays in photoemission, and interference degradation due to finite vacuum vorticity. We compare SST with established frameworks---from Kelvin's vortex atom hypothesis to emergent gravity and analogue fluid models---highlighting how SST recovers known limits (Newtonian gravity, Maxwell electrodynamics, quantum wave behavior) while providing novel, quantifiable predictions. All equations are given in SI units with attention to dimensional consistency. The result is a self-contained canonical reformulation that bridges classical and quantum physics through fluid-like continuum mechanics. vortex dynamics; topological fluid; quantum topology; emergent gauge theory; time dilation; wavefu",
