  "description": "% ============================================================ The magnetic moment of the electron is widely regarded as one of the most precisely tested quantities in physics. Dirac’s relativistic wave equation predicts a gyromagnetic ratio \\(g=2\\), while quantum electrodynamics (QED) accounts for the small anomalous correction with remarkable numerical accuracy. In standard presentations, the Dirac value is treated as exact at the one-particle level, with radiative effects merely perturbing it. Recent analysis has clarified that this narrative rests on implicit assumptions about electromagnetic self-interaction and mass dressing. When the electron’s self-field is treated consistently—already within relativistic single-particle theory—the magnetic moment inferred from the theory becomes state-dependent rather than universal. This raises a foundational question: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we summarize the conceptual implications of this self-interaction–induced indeterminacy. Second, we argue that Swirl-String Theory (SST) offers a natural resolution by replacing point-particle attributes with dynamically selected properties of extended excitations. % ============================================================",
