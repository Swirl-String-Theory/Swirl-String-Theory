  "description": "<p>Swirl&ndash;String Theory (SST) presents a fluid&ndash;topological framework in which matter and radiation are quantized vortex loops (&ldquo;swirl strings&rdquo;) embedded in a frictionless, incompressible condensate. Classical gravitational phenomenology is recovered as a pressure-driven effect in flat space, while local swirl kinematics reproduce relativistic time dilation. A covariant EFT on a preferred foliation organizes the clock (khronon) sector, two-form vorticity, and an emergent non-Abelian swirl connection that yields SM-like gauge dynamics after coarse-graining. A modified Faraday law introduces a swirl-induced source term, predicting geometry-independent, quantized flux impulses during topological events (nucleation/annihilation/reconnection). Wave&ndash;particle duality is treated as R/T phase dynamics; fermion masses follow a solitonic knot energy functional \\( m^{sol}_K = M_0 \\Xi_K \\)&nbsp; with a discrete-scale-invariance factor for chirality. The work details falsifiable signatures (SQUID flux quanta, BEC/superconductor analogues, attosecond delay sign flips), outlines a canonical knot&ndash;particle map, and compares SST with GR, SM, analogue gravity, and Skyrmion/Hopfion programs. All equations use SI units with dimensional checks.</p>",
