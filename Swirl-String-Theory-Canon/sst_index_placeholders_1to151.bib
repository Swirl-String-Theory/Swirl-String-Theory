2.1 Swirl Quantization Principle Swirl Quantization Principle. The joint discreteness of circulation and topology is the origin of quantum behavior in SST. Concretely, a swirl string’s circulation Γ is quantized in units of κ, and its allowed configurations are restricted to distinct knot classes [12, 13, 20]. This replaces canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics with topological and integrality conditions. In summary, discreteness arises from (a) Γ = nκ and (b) the knot

Theorem 7.1 (Swirl Gravity Mechanism in Flat Space) Chiral knotted swirl strings generate quantized long-range circulation that leads to mutual attraction. Consider a chiral knot K (e.g. a trefoil, 31) which encloses a straight central axis. Let C be a large loop encircling this axis.

5. Dual Phases (Wave–Particle): Each swirl string has two limiting phases: an extended R-phase (unknotted, delocalized circulation, wave-like) and a localized T-phase (knotted, particle-like). Quantum measurement corresponds to a dynamic transition between these phases (R→T collapse or T→R de-localization) accompanied by swirl radiation.

Its magnitude is anchored to the electromagnetic permeability scale µ0/(4π) = 10−7 in SI units, ensuring dimensional consistency between swirl energetics and EM normalization. Unlike the derived high-precision values of ρm and ρE , the effective fluid density ρf is defined at this tidy scale to serve as a reference baseline.
