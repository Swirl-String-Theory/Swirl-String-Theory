It systematically maps concepts and structures from string theory and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) into the hydrodynamic language of SST, where fundamental excitations are modeled as quantized swirl strings in an incompressible medium with characteristic swirl speed <span><span>v&thinsp;⁣↺\\mathbf{v}_{\\!\\boldsymbol{\\circlearrowleft}}</span><span><span><span><span>v</span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>↺</span></span></span></span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, core radius <span><span>rcr_c</span><span><span><span><span>r</span><span><span><span><span><span><span>c</span></span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, and effective density <span><span>&rho;&thinsp;⁣f\\rho_{\\!f}</span><span><span><span><span>&rho;</span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>f</span></span></span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<p>On the string theory side, the manuscript reinterprets key ingredients such as one-dimensional strings, branes, compactification scales, and world-sheet actions in terms of filamentary vorticity, swirl tension, and geometric foliations. On the QCD side, color charge, confinement, flux tubes, and hadron structure are expressed through SST&rsquo;s swirl-string bundles, knot topology, and pressure gradients. Where possible, standard field-theoretic quantities are rewritten in dimensionally consistent hydrodynamic form while preserving low-energy predictions.</p>\n<p>The goal is not to replace the established formalisms, but to provide a translation layer that allows results from string theory and QCD to be compared, reinterpreted, and potentially unified inside the SST framework. The document is intended as a working reference for subsequent SST papers, enabling readers trained in conventional quantum field theory to follow the SST program without adopting new notation from scratch.</p>\n<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> string theory, quantum chromodynamics, Swirl&ndash;String Theory, hydrodynamic reformulation, confinement, flux tubes, emergent geometry, vorticity.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>",
