  "description": "We present a first-principles derivation of the inverse-square law for static, weak gravitational forces as an emergent phenomenon in a flat, Lorentzian operational background.  Building on a recent relational-clock formulation of the Equivalence Principle~, we demonstrate explicitly how a \\(1/r^2\\) dependence arises in a hydrodynamic vortex model of matter consistent with Swirl-String Theory (SST). Three independent approaches are developed: (i) a  argument showing that a universal energy–energy interaction leads to a \\(1/r\\) potential when locality is imposed; (ii) a  for a foliation field sourced by mass, whose static solution yields the \\(1/r^2\\) field flux of a monopole; and (iii) a  derivation based on the stress-energy tensor of the SST scalar field, which reveals an area-weighted momentum flow that falls off as \\(1/r^2\\). We identify the SST field (the ``swirl-clock'' or foliation scalar) that carries the far-field momentum flux and derive its quadratic action and stress-energy tensor. The monopole solution is shown to produce a radial momentum flux density ",
