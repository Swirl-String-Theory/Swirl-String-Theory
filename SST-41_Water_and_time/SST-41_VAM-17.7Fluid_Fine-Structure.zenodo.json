  "description": "We investigate how a rapidly rotating, incompressible fluid contained in a cylinder responds when a neutrally buoyant spherical control volume on the axis is forced to move vertically. In the limit of small Rossby and Ekman numbers, linear rotating-fluid theory reduces to a compact vorticity-production law,\n\n        \\(\n        ",
