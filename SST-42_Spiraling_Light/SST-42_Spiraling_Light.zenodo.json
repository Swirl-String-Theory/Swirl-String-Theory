  "description": "We provide a Swirl--String Theory (SST) interpretation of the spiraling light and optical Magnus-effect phenomenology developed by Spreeuw~. In standard electromagnetism, a tightly focused, linearly polarized beam excites a circular dipole whose radiation carries transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM), behaves as if emitted from a source displaced by \\(k^{-1}=(10^{-16})\\) for optical wavelengths, so that current experiments probe the pure Maxwell limit of SST while still providing a precise Rosetta case for photon topology and spin--orbit coupling.",
